objective
to assist parties to arrive at a settlement on the repayment of loans on Mortgage Bonds , Deeds of Conditional Transfer and Deeds of transfer executed solely for a loan transaction in respect of immovable property
in addition thereto , the Amendment Act No. 29 of 1999 expanded this concession by enabling the Board to intervene in respect of transfer deeds executed purely for a loan transaction , resulting in further expansion of its relief support .

the functions of this Board are different from those of an ordinary court of law .
the settlement arrived at between the parties is not an agreement imposed by the Debt Conciliation Boards but one arrived at voluntarily by the parties .
However , the Board has the power to reduce the unreasonable rates of interest charged and to issue a certificate under the Ordinance to the debtors in case of failure on the part of the parties to accept the just suggestions made by the Board .
further , if the creditors fail to appear before the Board at the final hearing in response to the notice issued , a certificate is issued to the debtor after a one-sided hearing is held .

1 . Introduction
1.1 History of the Department
the determination of state and private lands and transferring to the relevant inherent for private ownership , the lands thus determined as a private issue of Survey plans to the said lands and transferring to the government is known as Land Settlement .
country required a process as this based on a historical backdrop .
despite the fact that the people of this country possessed and utilized lands for thousands of years , the transferring of ownership of those lands did not take place . those people did not have written proofs such as deeds and grants to confirm their title to these lands . under this circumstance , Crown Lands ( Encroachment ) Ordinance No : 12 was published by the British rulers in 1840 .
basically , the ordinance had in that in case of the failure on the part of a person to prove his title to a land , the said land gets confiscated . the people descended possession and cultivation was not taken into consideration by the British rulers . what they meant here was that ownership must only be confirmed through written proofs such as deeds and grants .
in this scenario , people were deprived thousands of acres of their precious lands as a result of the Crown Lands ( Encroachment ) Ordinance in 1940 . the local leaders then expressed their regret and protest over this injustice meted out for the people of this country . accordingly , as a solution for this , the British rulers were compelled to initiate a process to determine as to what the private and state lands are .

5 . Development Activities
5.1 Implementation of the Title Registration Act and Progress
5.1.1 Implementation of the Title Registration Act and the Expansion of the Bim Saviya Programme
accordingly , the department was able to implement the programme in 52 Divisional Secretary ’ s Divisions in 17 districts of the country by the end of the year 2013 and steps are taken to initiate the programme in another 63 Divisional Secretary ’ s Divisions in 18 districts in the year 2014 .
5.1.2 Implementation of Title Registration Activities at Divisional Level
presently , the programme is implemented under a new methodology at present where the basic information about land is collected through Grama Seva Niladharis and the information is classified and forwarded to the Department of Surveys for demarcation .
accordingly , due to the ability of solving land related issues before the surveying is taken place , the efficiency of the programme and the confidence of the public on the programme is expected to be increased .
after receiving the related demarcations form the department of surveys , the investigation is carried out regarding the particular land parcels by the regional offices of our department that established covering each divisional secretary ’ s division .
the title determinations which were published in the Government Gazette were forwarded to relevant Title registrars directly by the head office of the department until the year 2011 and from the year 2012 this procedure was decentralized to our regional offices enabling the public to fulfil their requirements more conveniently and efficiently .
5.1.3 Progress of the Year 2014
in this year , requests for demarcations about 78,900 newly identified and settle land parcels have been forwarded to the Department of Surveys and this will contribute in an increase of the progress of coming years .
total progress up to the year 2014 is indicated in the Annexure 03 , 04 and 05 .
5.1.4 Progress of the Determinations of the Titles 2011-2014
Progress of the programme of Title settlement has developed gradually since 2011 and the progress achieved in 2014 has increased in 48.94 % in comparison with the number of Land parcels in the cadastral map given by the Department of surveys to be gazzetted under section 12
5.1.5 Solutions for Legal Issues
Although , Title Registration Act 1998 has been introduced to determine the ownership of a land , the deed system or document registration which had been in use up to now for claiming the ownership of a land remains still valid for the lands which are not categorized under Title Registration Act .
Likewise , the department was able to provide solutions to the public without putting themselves in difficulty as a result of the shortcomings remain when adhering the old system and the issues encountered in the new system in the year 2013 .
strengthening the legal section of the Department , in order to settle the legal issues of the public which come into existence with the expansion of this programme , has taken place in 2013 and accordingly two new positions for Legal Officers have been approved .
further , it has been reported to public service commission to recruit the selected officers by holding interviews .
5.2 Progress of the Implementation of the Land Settlement Ordinance in 2014
out of the gross total extent of 6,561,000 hectares of the country , extents of 1,902,064 hectares have been excluded from the Title Settlement procedure .
in the Administrative Report issued by the department for the year 1931 , it has been stated that lands with a higher population density , lands with clear boundaries and State owned and private lands have been subjected to such exclusion .
it was targeted in the year 2014 to complete the settlement in 70 villages in the districts of Puttalam , Kurunegala , Rathnapura , Badulla , Monaragala , Kandy , Nuwara Eliya , Matale , Ampara that represent the districts in which the settlement procedure was yet to be completed , within the total extent of 4,658,936 hectares that had been selected for Title Settlement .

Research Work in Astronomy
morphology study of comet 2012 S1 ( ISON )
comet ISON found in 2012 was a new comer to the solar system from oort cloud where most of the icy objects are found to be lurking around .
the study of such new comers provides valuable insights on the origin of the solar system .
previous research works on comet morphology were studied .
optical filters , 445 / 20nm Brightline Single band filter and 387 / 11nm Brightline Single band filter were procured for carrying out the scientific observations on comet ISON .
Unfortunately , Comet did not survive during its perihelion passage around the Sun on 28th October 2013 . therefore , Research had to be abandoned .
study of Solar Flares using CALLISTO Radio Spectrometer
CALLISTO is a radio spectrometer which has a log periodic Antenna and a radio frequency receiver that can detect the radio burst emerging from the sun during solar flares .
one such CALLISTO system has been successfully set up at ACCIMT by the scientists of the Space Applications Division of the Institute .
now the data gathered from the CALLISTO is being uploaded to the e-Callisto main server at Switzerland .
the fist result was observed by the system detecting type III solar radio burst .
Abstract was submitted to a conference “ Radio and Antenna Days of the Indian Ocean ” under the title of “ Construction of an e-CALLISTO Station in Sri Lanka ” . Research paper was submitted to the 30th Technical Sessions of the Institute of Physics Sri Lanka ( IPSL ) .
study on P Cygni type stars
the P Cygni type stars have expanding atmospheres and the studies of the star have revealed a unique spectral feature due to the Doppler Effect , called the P Cygni spectral line profile .
the P Cygni type star HD 193237 ( 34 Cyg ) was observed in medium resolution spectroscopy at the GOTO 45cm telescope at ACCIMT . the equivalent width of the Hα ( H alpha ) line was found to be 49A0 .
the radial velocity of the blue shifted component of Hα line was found to be 221km / s and agrees with the value found in previous studies .
the radial velocities of blue shifted absorption components of Hβ ( H Beta ) found in the research is 238 Km / s and is higher than the value found in previous studies .
the blue shifted component of the HeI line found in this study is around 185km / s and is in agreement with the previous values .
the radial velocity values for blue shifted Balmer series spectral lines Hα , Hβ , Hγ and Hδ which should be originated in the different regions of the expanding envelop have found to be decreasing with the higher orders of the series .
project was completed .
study the different orientations of the disk-like envelopes surrounded in Be Stars through their emission line spectra
be stars are mainly characterized by their Balmer emission lines in their optical spectra , which originate in an envelope of circum-stellar matter .
it has been found that these envelopes are indeed quite flattened and are consistent with some kind of equatorial disk .
determining the actual geometry of Be star disks has been the focus of many theoretical and observational investigations .
in this project 29 Hα emission line profiles of randomly selected Be stars were analyzed and identified their disks orientations as Pole-on , normal and shell .
Although HD 58343 , HD 76868 and HD 56139 stars are in good agreement with the theoretical profiles they showed peculiar behavior in their projected rotational velocities .
also found that the separations between double Hα peaks decrease with increasing Hα Equivalent Widths .
when the Equivalent Widths ( EWs ) of Hα emissions increase , the photospheric absorption line wings start to disappear and at the same time H alpha profiles appear as single peaks instead of double peaks .
it was also found that Hα emissions with small EWs ( EW &lt; -10A  ) have photospheric absorption line wings in both side of the profiles .
the following collaborative astronomical research projects were undertaken with the local Universities
Determination of chemical abundance of few selected stars observed through 45cm telescope at ACCIMT
the curve of growth method is used to find the chemical abundances of the stellar atmospheres .
the main objective of this project is to observe several bright stars through the 45cm telescope in medium resolution spectroscopy at Arthur C. Clarke Institute ( ACCIMT ) and find out the chemical abundances of the stars and compare them with the accepted values .
observed spectra were wavelength calibrated using IRAF facility .
theoretical spectra were generated using spectral synthesis computer code “ Spectrum ” using Kuruz model atmosphere data files corresponding to the observed stars . equivalent widths of few selected iron spectral lines were measured .
element abundances are being measured using curve of growth method .
Research continues .
Research Work in RS / GIS
Development of Geospatial Agricultural Information System ( GAIS )
the objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive web GIS based application for Geospatial Agricultural Information System for Sri Lanka using open source technologies .
the Geospatial Agricultural Information is available with various resources in various formats across the country . the standardized and centralized application of information makes it convenient to disseminate , access and visualize the geospatial data to cater the various application user needs .
the project will be worked out in classifying the various tree species in the agriculture sector . Comparing library values and the analyzed values by the clustered imagery data , it will allow verifying the tree species in the agriculture sector and predicting the changes in the tree species for a specific area .
the summary can be viewed in a graphical user friendly method on the web GIS application .
for the feasibility study , a database is developed for disseminate the spatial data to access from client machine .
we have selected 4 sample areas from each two set of Spatial data ( two images taken for the study ) . using by flowing three steps each of every samples was analyzed .
developed NDVI ( Normalized Difference Vegetation Index ) image for each samples .
a NDVI is an equation that takes into account the amount of infrared reflected by plants .
live green plants absorb solar radiation . the reason NDVI is related to vegetation is that healthy vegetation reflects very well in the near-infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum .
classified NDVI images - the most common approach in classifying composited time series of the NDVI is unsupervised classification , where pixels are assigned to a user-defined number of classes based on a cluster analysis .
Exported the pixel details in text format from classified NDVI image .
Conversion of spatial data in text format is important for coding to query the data from database .
thereby 12 images out of 24 were generated and 4 tables out of 8 were created .
Stored the created NDVI images and pixel details to analyze the surface variation of vegetation coverage in the same area . it was found specifically different between the classified 12 NDVI images and 4 tables in the year 1992 and 2001 .

we have been able to launch the hazard profiles on the National Safety Day which fell on 26th December 2012 as the initial step of formulating risk profiles , which are fundamental for Disaster Preparedness Response and for planning Disaster Risk Reduction measures .
Similarly , its specific that we have been able to obtain the approval of the National Council for the National Disaster Management Plan .
it should be noted that the continuous guidance extended by the Interim Management Committee , which has been established under the direction and guidelines of the National Council for Disaster Management instituted as per the provisions of Sri Lanka Disaster Management Act have been instrumental in accomplishing the responsibilities of the Disaster Management Center during the year 2012 .
ability to evacuate 100 % of the vulnerable communities residing in the coastal line using the Tsunami early warning messages issued by the Meteorological Department on 12th April 2012 , reflects the efficiency of the Tsunami early warning system which has been installed by the Disaster Management Center and it assures the ability to face a future disaster of this kind .
in addition , I would like to state that we have been able to successfully and efficiently respond the disasters of droughts , floods and storms in the year 2012 .
I would like to remember with gratitude the support extended by the Hon. Minister of Disaster Management , Hon.

2.5 Director General ’ s review on Opportunities and Constraints in 2012
2.5.1 Opportunities
1 ) The Disaster Management Center has the opportunity to conduct disaster risk reduction activities as the community and policy makers are addressing the increasing trend .
2 ) Local and regional experience and recognition gained by the D.M.C. increase the demand for a good base for future actions .
3 ) With the technology presently available , the D.M.C. can move forward in implementing its Disaster Risk Management related activities .
4 ) DMC is in a good position to meet the present challenges as it has already developed hazard maps , preparedness &amp; response plans at different levels , guidelines and operational procedures etc .
5 ) Availability of latest technologies internationally would be a good opportunity , if accessible by the D.M.C. , to be used in proactive Disaster Risk Management measures .
2.5.2 Constraints
I . maintaining Grama Niladari level Committees
D.M.C. has established Grama Niladari Level Disaster Management Committees in all areas vulnerable to tsunami , landslide , floods etc .
GN level committees have been identifying the areas in which the district level disaster management mechanism should be implemented .
therefore , building the capacity of GN committees is essential to carry out grass root level disaster management activities .
Furthermore , conducting awareness programs is also required to sustain enthusiasm of the communities in villages .
II . I.C.T. Equipment Training
- D.M.C. needs to have highly efficient communication systems to reach lower levels in emergency situations .
- Presently D.M.C. is being equipped with radio communication systems , but is insufficient to cover the entire vulnerable population .
- In order to carry out awareness programs for vulnerable communities , D.M.C. must have sufficient equipment such as laptop computers , multimedia projectors , cameras etc .
lack of such equipment hinders the effectiveness of training programs .
- Search &amp; Rescue is a vital component in emergencies .
the military has formed search and rescue teams in all districts as per the directive given by H.E. the President at the National Council for Disaster Management .
- Although search and rescue teams have been formed , they are in short supply of equipment that is vital to carry out the tasks assigned to them .
the funds that have been allocated by the Ministry of Disaster Management are insufficient and military funds are also limited .
- These teams need to be properly trained to meet international standards .
Although several requests have been made to international organizations such as JICA , Red Cross , ADPC , it has not materialized yet .
III . provincial level coordination
since D.M.C has no senior level representation at the provincial level , problems arise in implementing disaster management programs at the provincial level .
iv . need for a Monitoring and Evaluation Unit in the D.M.C
D.M.C has spent a considerable amount of funds to carry out disaster management activities annually .
the allocation for Disaster Risk Management activities carried out during the year 2012 amounts to Rs . 260 million and Rs . 506 million has been allocated in the year 2013 .
Furthermore D.M.C also receives funds from other INGOs and United Nations Agencies .
V. Inadequate funds for maintenance of equipment and systems
D.M.C has established 77 Tsunami warning towers in areas vulnerable to the Tsunami and radio communication systems are being used in all the districts to communicate in emergencies .
Furthermore , highly valuable software and servers are being used by DMC .
as such the D.M.C has to bear the cost of license renewals , maintenance of equipment etc . , for which additional funds are needed .
vi . issues related to data sharing
D.M.C had taken the lead role in promoting data sharing pertaining to Disaster Risk Reduction such as rainfall , landslide , flood etc .
presently it has been observed that some of the government organizations are reluctant to share data .
vii . climate Change and its adverse effects
due to climate change , unusual weather patterns are being experienced during the last few years .
therefore a large number of disasters could occur , including unpredicted rainfall within a short period of time .
houses , infrastructure , crops , livestock would be affected due to these extreme weather conditions .
viii . private Sector Partnership
there is a need to link up with the private sector to streamline Government Disaster Risk Reduction programs , because it can reduce the impact of disasters on the community and make life safer for the community .
2.5.3 Recommendations
a . Resources are required for continuous capacity building and for community based Disaster Risk Reduction .
B . funds are required to purchase I.C.T equipment such as laptop computers , multimedia projectors , cameras and for the maintenance of ICT equipment , Early Warning System and servers .
C . equipment is required for Search and Rescue teams and it is necessary to obtain international assistance for training of Search and rescue teams .
D . a dedicated Monitoring and Evaluation Unit needs to be established in D.M.C to ensure that funds are being utilized effectively in projects implemented by the D.M.C .
E . collaboration and coordination with local authorities needs to be improved .
it is recommended to have a senior officer representing the D.M.C in all provincial councils for Disaster Management activities .
F . a mechanism should be established to improve data sharing and collaboration among key stakeholders in D.M .
G . climate change adaptation measures need to be implemented to minimize impacts of climate change .
Furthermore , it needs to be noted that even though Disaster Risk Reduction measures are implemented , it is inevitable that a disaster could occur .
therefore , strengthening community resilience and emergency response capacities should be given priority .
H . private sector involvement in disaster risk management programs and dissemination to the public .

4 . mitigation , Research and Development Division Director ’ s Report
4.1 Introduction
Disaster information and data analysis by the Mitigation , Research and Development Division of the Disaster Management Center revealed that during the last five years , disasters such as floods , landslides , drought , cyclone , coastal hazards , animal attacks etc. have occurred very frequently .
these disasters have a heavy impact on the national economy directly as the Government spends large sums of money for disaster response , relief services , rehabilitation and reconstruction .
further the disasters collapse the social life , which has an adverse impact on a daily income of the local communities .
therefore the D.M.C has identified the importance of disaster mitigation in the country .
based on the analysis of the past records of disasters and their impacts , the D.M.C has prioritized the areas prone to different disasters .
4.2 Allocation of Funds for Mitigation Projects in 2012

04 . operational Review
4.1 Performance
4.1.1 Disaster Risk Minimizing projects
( I ) Agreed
a sum of Rs . 36.85 million had been allocated for the implementation of projects in the Hambantota District .
about 07 of those projects could not be completed during year 2012 due to natural causes like heavy rains and floods . hence , those projects were started in the year 2012 and completed in the year 2013 .
an estimated sum of Rs . 69 million was obtained for the implementation of the Kirama Oya project and approval for the project has been obtained based on the Coast Conservation Department .
accordingly , approval was obtained from the Department of National Planning to implement the project .
when field tests were carried out to implement the project , a problematic situation occurred based on the lands of the relevant area and consequently a meeting was held with the participation of the political authority of the area , representatives of the local government bodies and the general public .
at the meeting the local government body agreed to get the consent of the land owners to give their lands for the construction of a road of about 10 feet wide parallel to the Gabion wall along Kirama Oya and action was taken for that .
but the funds approved for that year was not received even by the end of the year and consequently the project could not be launched during that year .
( II ) Flood mitigation projects in the Vavuniya District had been completed during the year 2012 , and obtaining the requisition forms related to payment by the Vavuniya District Secretariat was delayed .
( III ) In Jaffna District ,

4 . construction of culverts in Thennamarachchi area for Protection from floods Rs . 6,000,000.00
the above projects were proposed to be implemented and approval has been obtained to implement the project indicated by the number 1 above within three years .
the approved amount for that project was Rs . 18.20 million for year 2012 .
but the amount received from the Treasury for that was Rs.12.0 million .
accordingly , payment for the work that was completed in the year 2012 was made with the allocations for the year 2013 .
the projects under Nos. 2 , 3 and 4 were completed in the year 2012 and payments were made .
( iv ) Although a sum of Rs.12.5 million was granted for making payments for the work of this project , an investigation was being carried out through the Presidential Investigations Unit regarding the sand and soil that were removed , and the trees that were cut down when implementing the project .
consequently , the payments could not be made and the money allocated for that project was spent on other projects .
( V ) ( i ) Agreed
an advance of Rs . 3.36 million was granted for rain water cultivation development project in Mannar .
the construction of the culverts for that amount had been completed , since the Treasury did not receive funds from the Treasury during that year , the project was delayed due to lack of allocations received from the Treasury during that year and therefore , action has been taken to continue the activities of the project in the year 2013 .
( II ) ( iii ) Agreed
Ilanga systems development projects in Anuradhapura and Kurunegala were completed in year 2013 and payments have been made .
( iv ) Agreed
the project for the construction of crocodile cages in Matara River could not be completed due to the high level of water in the Nilwala River .
that project was completed in year 2013 .
according the decision that had been made to grant the provisions for year 2013 directly to the National Building Research Organization , action has been taken to grant the relevant provisions considering the fact that it is an entity coming under the same Ministry .
4.1.2 Preparing preparedness plans
( a ) The action plan for the year 2012 was prepared for the amount of money that had been approved by the Treasury under the Expenditure Vote for the Prepared Planning Division and funds were released for the preparedness projects of the 25 districts in the first , second and the third quarters .
further , as there was no separate Expenditure Vote for the awareness and the training programs conducted by the training division and the funds were provided for them under the Expenditure Vote for preparedness .
at present a sum of Rs . 87,866 / - has to be settled in this regard and action will be taken to settle it promptly .
all the funds that were granted under the Vote of expenditure for preparedness in year 2011 for various preparedness activities have been settled by now .
( B ) Agreed
form PP / 06 / A was introduced for easy settlement of the funds of the Disaster Management Centre and the Assistant Directors in Districts were informed in advance that funds should be settled using this form .
accordingly , certified copies of the participant name lists are now attached by all the districts when settling money . ( Kindly be informed that the list of names of the participants of each program are available )
further , most of the programs conducted by the Preparedness Division are one-day workshops and expenses are properly reimbursed through bills .
at the beginning of the year , an annual action plan was prepared on a district basis for preparedness activities under the instructions of the Disaster Management Centre and accordingly a monthly action plan is obtained before the 15th of the month prior to the relevant month .
in addition , for the programs that are conducted before funds are released , details like the estimated amount , the venues for the programs etc. are obtained .
However , it has been impossible to conduct these programs as planned in advance due to the delay in providing financial provisions .
( C ) Cannot be agreed
all the preparedness programs are not awareness programs and rehearsal drills , preparation of plans , drawing maps and updating committees are among them .
However , most of these programs are conducted by the officers of the District Disaster Management Units and the Disaster Management Center has developed their knowledge and skills for this purpose .
therefore , awareness programs have been conducted by obtaining the service of the trained officers of the Disaster Management Center instead of outsourcing the service of resource persons .
further , these awareness programs are conducted with the participation of the officers of the Department of Meteorology and the National Building Research Organization which represent the Ministry of Disaster Management .
( D ) Although the Preparedness Division has prepared an action plan for the districts on monthly and quarterly basis for conducting preparedness programs , it was difficult to conduct the programs on the due dates as lined up in the plans due to the delay in receiving funds .
consequently , a situation arose where settling of advances too , which was not done .
However , particular attention will be paid in future regarding taking action to settle advances .
( E ) Preparation of district disaster management plans has been completed for 24 districts by now and the plans for the 06 districts namely , Vavuniya , Killinochchi , Mannar , Trincomalee , Ampara and Jaffna are yet to be printed .
it is planned to complete the printing process soon and preparation of the disaster management plan for the remaining Mulativu district is being done .
purchase of Equipment for Flood Disaster Operations
( a ) Agreed
Disaster Management Center had requested a sum of Rs . 20.5 million for the purchase of equipment for the year 2012 , and a provision of Rs . 18.65 million has been allocated .
the equipment was purchased only with the funds received as the project did not receive the funds .
even though the equipment was allocated to the district according to individual needs , the purchased equipment could not be delivered to the planned site due to the sudden floods and droughts that year .
accordingly the equipment was distributed to the places that required them under the urgent situation that was created .
if it had not been done in that manner , there would have been a great loss of lives and property .
therefore , it is informed that the equipment could not be distributed to designated places as planned and action will be taken to distribute the equipment purchased in the future to those places .
( B ) Agreed
out of the amount that was estimated for the purchase of the water bowser , about Rs 1 Million was remaining which was used to purchase some boats , which are essential , again on a 50 % purchase basis .
once again additional time was taken to send these equipment to the relevant places than what was determined in the procurement plan submitted by us .
( C ) Agreed
action has been taken to distribute 2076 life jackets purchased in 2012 in different sizes ( based on the requirement of each district ) through the District Offices .
accordingly , together with the occurrence of the disaster situation in early January 2013 , action has been taken promptly to distribute the relevant items to the district offices and the items have been released from the stores with proper approval .
a difference was noticed between the stock book and the actual stock during the physical survey of the stocks as the storekeeper had not made entries in the stocks register at the time of issuing the relevant articles .
the store keeper had stated that he had not made entries in the stock book as all the GRNs which confirm the receipt of all the articles distributed to the district offices had not been received for each occasion .
accordingly , the storekeeper has been instructed to take action to make entries in the stock book at the same time when articles are issued from the stores in future .
he was further advised that action should be taken to prevent the occurrence of such shortcomings in future .
Grants from Non-governmental Organizations
( a ) Agreed
measures have been taken at present to keep the Department of External Resources informed when receiving all the Grants from Non-Governmental Organisations .
( B ) Action has been taken to maintain a file containing information on expenses related to all the contracted amounts relevant to the funds provided by various organisations .
( C ) The funds provided by various organisations have been spent in terms of the agreements that have been entered into with the relevant organisations and after obtaining the approval of the Director General of the Center .
measures will be taken in future to carry out the activities with action plans as pointed out by the audit .
( D ) Agreed
Although it had been planned to distribute these books with the coordination of the Ministry of Education , it could not be done due to the failure of the Ministry of Education to provide the information on the education zones to which the relevant books should be distributed to the Disaster Management Center .
the Ministry of Education has provided the relevant information by now and plans have been made to hand over these sets of books to the Ministry of Education in due course together with the other sets of books provided by the United Nations Development Program .
( E ) With the provision of Rs . 665,889 / - granted by ADPC , 30 officers of the staff grade of the Department of National Planning have been given a two-day training on how the process of disaster risk reduction should be implemented within the process of national planning .
( F ) After completing the relevant activities with the funds received from Local and Foreign Non-Governmental Organisations for various programs , the whole of the remaining amount of money was transferred to an account which was opened for the purchase of all Information Technology equipment in the deposit ledger as per the decision taken at the meeting of the Finance Committee of the Disaster Management Center .
then some payments were made from that account for the purchase of certain items which are necessary for the continuation of the activities of the Center .
we acted in this manner for the betterment and the progress of the center as the funds allocated from the 2012 budget for the recurrent activities of the Center was not sufficient for the same .
the amount of Rs . 1,316,454 / = which was in the deposit account named Purchasing Information Technology Equipment was used by us to purchase office equipment , furniture , and computer accessories which were required when shifting the Center to a new building in 2012 and also for the newly recruited staff .
as the sum of Rs . 64,000 / - which had been allocated by the 2012 budget for these activities was insufficient , the center has provided the necessary facilities .

4.4 Staff Administration
( a ) Filling the vacancies existing in the positions of the staff grade
the recruitment procedure for the post of Additional Director General was approved on 12.12.2012 .
Although applications were called for recruitment to 03 director posts of this Centre through newspaper advertisements on 04 occasions , only a limited number of applications had been received .
None of these applicants could be appointed mainly due to their lack of basic qualifications and due to the fact that some of them demanded high salaries and other privileges .
accordingly , it was assumed based on the previous experience that a similar situation could occur when calling applications for the post of Additional Director General and therefore , after obtaining the approval of the National Council for Disaster Management for recruitment on secondment basis , applications were called through newspaper advertisements , but there was no applicant possessing the basic qualifications required for the position and so far the vacancy has not been filled .
there are 07 vacancies for the position of Deputy Director of the Center and all those vacancies should be filled through the internal promotions of the Center according to the recruitment procedure of the Center .
this was brought to the attention of the National Council for Disaster Management and approval was sought for recruitment on a temporary secondment basis for a period of up to five years .
after obtaining approval for that , applications were called for the post of Deputy Director through newspaper advertisements at the same time as the above Additional Director General was appointed .
even among these applicants , there was no one who possessed the basic qualifications required for the relevant posts , so all those posts remain vacant at present .
Although 06 positions of Assistant District Director were vacant in the center , officers attached from the Sri Lanka Army and the Sri Lanka Air Force have been deployed for those positions from the very beginning .
according to a decision made at the meeting of the National Council for Disaster Management held on 25 November 2011 headed by HE the President and Chairman of National Council for Disaster Management Mahinda Rajapakse , it was decided to continue to deploy the officers who are attached to the Sri Lanka Army and the Air Force in those positions of the Center hence those 06 Assistant District Directors continue to work in those positions .
accordingly the relevant 6 positions continue to remain vacant .
( B ) Recruitment procedure and appointments
( I ) In terms of Section 10 of Chapter II of the Establishments Code , the relevant persons whose medical examination reports and oaths or affirmation are not available in their personal files have been informed of it in writing and action has been taken to obtain the relevant reports by sending reminder letters to certain officers .
( II ) As most of the documents in the personal files were uncertified photocopies , the relevant officers / employees were informed of it in writing and action has been taken to get the originals of the relevant documents and to get the photocopies certified by the Administrative Officer or the Assistant Director ( Human Resource ) and file them .
necessary action has been taken to notify those who do not submit the relevant certificates by letters of reminder .
( C ) Recruiting staff to this Center has been done since 2006 and all those recruitments have been done on contract basis .
by the time the Centre was provided with vehicles , drivers had not been recruited and therefore the recruitment of drivers had to be done promptly , applications have been called after publishing notices internally and in Divisional Secretariat Offices and the relevant recruitment has been done after conducting the formal structured interviews .

Chairman ’ s Message
International Science and Technology Centre
in order to fulfill the medical needs of ITI employees , the institute was successfully able to implement a contributory Medical Insurance scheme for its staff , with the Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation , which was a much needed move and a long awaited requirement .
the PF 380 circular was , to a certain extent , implemented for the consultancy services of the staff members , thus enriching the researchers in their efforts in promoting such services rendered by them .
the necessary foundation was laid by ITI for the formation of its Toast Masters Club by enrolling 20 staff members who graduated through speech crafter programme and also are chartered toast Masters
the Institute ’ s income grew by 30.25 % in 2013 to Rs . 207.5 million compared with Rs . 159.3 million in 2012 .
when compared with the increased of income in the past three years , a percentage of 7.8 % and 17.3 % in the years of 2012 and 2013 respectively records a recordable income increase of 30.25 % as opposed to the previous year ’ s increase in the income .
the Technical Services Division continued to be the biggest earner with its income improving to Rs . 160 million compared with Rs . 124.2 million earned in the previous year .
a special feature demonstrated by the Technical Services Division was demonstrating their innovative and research activities by transferring a technology for a Rain Gauge machine as a successful project .
this enable to increase the income of Rs . 2.8 million received in the year 2013 from technology transfer upto Rs . 3 million in 2013 .
However , the ratio of income and reimbursement expenses decreased to 87 % in 2013 from the high of 94.5 % achieved last year .
personnel emoluments increased by 25 % in 2013 largely upto Rs . 51.4 million due to the new salary scale and the approved Scheme of Recruitment ( SOR ) , while the rise of 19.3 % in total reimbursement expenses reflected inflationary and foreign exchange movements in the economy .
these developments led to an increase in expenditure per employee by 0.06 % in 2013 , which was much greater than the 0.09 % increase shown in income generated by each employee .
the construction of the bridge of the access road from Chandrika Kumaranatunga Mawatha to the site was completed acquiring additional land .
the Institute has had successful discussions with relevant authorities to obtain financing for the construction of the Advanced Materials Technology Division .
However , these barriers can be substantially overcome by taking measures such as distribution of research grants ( including projects funded by Treasury funds ) and income from research projects to employees .
However , the arrears to be paid for the promotions and replacement of the previous posts were accelerated within a short period of four months .
ITI continues to play a major role in assisting Sri Lankan industry by providing a wide range of internationally and locally accredited laboratory services .
out of the 7 Major sections at ITI , 3 are accredited by SWEDAC ( Swedish Board for Accreditation &amp; Conformity Assessment ) and SLAB ( Sri Lanka Accreditation Board ) while one major section is accredited by the Sri Lanka agency , SLAB .
further , more than 130 services are accredited by SWEDAC .
the Institute supported local industry by providing a wide range of calibration services to industry .
ITI conducted quality management in microbiological analysis for foreign scientists by continuously maintaining its international image and conducting overseas laboratory services .
established a post of Marketing Manger which was ( vacancy ) a requirement for applied technical knowledge and transferring it to industry .
continued to carry out research on issues faced by industry and on critical technical issues facing the country .
in addition to the role played by the ITI when investigating the contamination of milk powder products by the DCD compound , the role played by the Institute on disasters resulted from natural issues is detailed in the following pages of the Annual Report .
this in turn reflects the confidence and the faith the said stakeholders have placed on ITI .
as described more fully in the report , this work has been in the fields of noise and vibration pollution including those on newly built ships , the high ways , atmospheric emissions and solid waste and waste water management .
the ITI is part of a large-scale project aimed at controlling dengue mosquito by keeping the surrounding environment clean , preventing mosquito breeding places , and making the staff aware of preventing dengue menace .
as an initiative to protect pubic from chronic kidney Disease ITI has develop a low cost Red Clay filter to be distributed among the public in affected areas .
this has the unique feature of filtering fluoride and heavy metals such as Arsenic and Cadmium .
after the completion of the ongoing testing ITI will be able to release this filter with the ITI trademark to the market in the future .
a model of sharing revenue generated through projects was established by ITI when sharing facilities and equipment of ITI with the private sector and those would be used on most of such partnerships in the future .
Dr. Sirimal Premakumara , who served for many years at the ITI , was appointed as the new Director General / Chief Executive Officer of the Institute .
on behalf of the Board , I wish to take this opportunity to thank him for his assistance extended to the Institute during his short period in the capacity of Director General / CEO of the institute .

Number of training programs were carried out to transfer small and medium technology with the assistance of government and international organisation to uplift the economy of the rural population .
fish products processing , Rice based products , processing of bottled fried sprat , Kithul beverages and Kithul jelly were some of the high demand programmes conducted during the year .
Provision OF INTERNATIONALLY COMPETITIVE TECHNOLOGICAL SERVICES
in addition , Laboratory Quality Management Systems , Industrial Metrology , Food Safety Services ( HACCP ) , ISO 17025 , ISO 15819 ( Medical Testing ) were also provided to research institutes and various industries .
the Information Service Centres and R &amp; D Laboratories with ISO 9001 : 2008 certification status were constantly operated .
during the year , 130 environmental consultancies were undertaken for minimization of air , water , solid waste , and noise pollution caused by industries .
a wide range of industries obtained our services .
improving Social Well-Being - Health-Nutritional Environmental Disparities
by using expertised knowledge relevant to the ITI &apos;s role in the health and well-being of consumers is constantly being utilized to avoid nationally important issues .
at the request of the Ministry of Research and Technology , ITI accepted the challenge of testing the contamination of DCD in imported powdered milk .
DCD is a chemical added to the lawn to reduce greenhouse gases and nitrogen accessing water ways .
Although DCD does not indicate as a health hazard in books , high doses of DCD can harm human health .
in Rathupaswala , a controversy has been erupted between the villagers and a latex glove manufacturing factory about the effluent water disposal of the factory .
being the only technical institute with accredited facility to measure the volume of noise in the country , ITI is called by the Urban Development Athourity to give an opinion on noise pollution to the residents along Katunayake Expressway .
the institute developed the volume of sound insulation that should be built to reduce the amount of IMMI and this was the first time that sound insulation was built in Sri Lanka .
rapid R &amp; D Activities of ITI
scientists and engineers working at ITI are constantly encouraged to pursue post-graduate degrees in their respective fields .
during the year , three researchers received their doctorate and four others continue their doctoral studies .
one researcher registered for the doctorate .
publications of thirty nine research papers covering different areas were presented by research scientists and research engineers of our institute .
this is a significant increase in the number of research articles published during the year .
human Resources
Surani Samarasekara , the Senior Deputy Director at the Information Services Centre retired in December .
Employee Relations and Welfare
the year began with traditional New Year celebrations organized jointly by the Buddhist Society and the Welfare and Recreation Club .
the annual preaching sermons was exerted together with Vesak and Poson ceremonies and the Vesak lantern competition for the 6th consecutive year were organized by the Buddhist Society .
the Christian Society celebrated Christmas party singing carol and distributing of gifts to the children of ITI staff .
Financial performance
reimbursement expenses increased from 169 Million to Rs . 176.6 Million , while the capital grant increased from Rs . 97.2 Million to Rs . 146.7 Million .
Institute income showed a significant increase of 31 % from Rs . 188.4 Million in 2012 to Rs . 246.8 Million in 2013 , while the reimbursement expenses increased by 21.2 % from 314.3 Million to 380.8 Million .
the income and reimbursement expenses ratio showed an upward trend from 60 % to 65 % .
Research and calibration services contributed 56.5 % ( Rs . 139.5 Million ) of the generated income while income from contracts and consulting services showed an increase from 18.2 Million in 2012 to 25.3 Million in this year .
revenue from technology transfer showed a 43 % increase from last year ’ s figure of Rs . 2.8 Million to 4.0 Million .
high percentage of income generated by the institute is from testing and calibration services while income from technology transfer and R &amp; D is around 5 % .
Although the triple tax relief to industries have been provided with external resources for R &amp; D , it does not have much impact on the desired objectives .
in achieving the ambition of making Sri Lanka a regional knowledge hub by 2016 , it is imperative that Institutions like ITI make strong endeavors to play a key role in this area .

noise barriers on Katunayake Expressway
Katunayake expressway runs through several towns and residential areas in marshy lands , which are sensitive to the noise pollution .
while constructing Katunayake Expressway a disparity between the RDA and construction company arose on the total length of the noise barriers .
in Sri Lanka , there are no rules and regulations on noise control in highway construction .
ITI experts had to depend on the exsisting data and to study criteria developed by other countries on highway noise control .
based on the experience of the sound quality of traffic on the Southern Expressway provided by the Road Development Authority ( RDA ) , the noise level was determined by assuming traffic on the highway .
this consultancy project is a milestone to ITI as well as in the highway legend in Sri Lanka in many ways .
this is the first time that the IMMI Noise Modeling software was used to design noise barriers and it is the first time that the noise barriers were erected on highways in Sri Lanka .
supply and installation of Automated Rain Gauges to NBRO
a key factor for the landslides is heavy rainfall within short periods .
monitoring rainfall especially in areas highly vulnerable to landslide is important in avoiding disasters .
National Building Research Organisation ( NBRO ) is the designated body in Sri Lanka for landslide monitoring , mitigation and management .
this instrument provides data to be shared on-line by authorized officers through an access controlled web application .
NBRO has identified ITI ’ s Automated Rain Gauge as the most suitable equipment for short time rainfall monitoring and predicting imminent landslides and requested the installation of thirty five rain gauges in Kandy , Matale , Kegalle , Kurunegala , Nuwara Eliya and Badulla .
further , the operation and maintenance of these automated rain gauges has also been given to ITI for the next three years . ‍
Evaluation of Sri Lankan traditional rice varieties for anti-inflammatory and lipid-lowering activities
it should be noted that some of them have anti-inflammatory and lipid lowering properties .
However , it must be acknowledged that it is incapable of presenting scientifically documented data .
to meet this need , ITI conducted a special research analyzing four traditional rice varieties , namely Sudu Heenati , Goda Heenati , Masuran and Dik Wee .
it has been demonstrated that the researched rice varieties have a variety of mechanisms enabaling anti-inflammatory activity and to a certain extent have the ability to maintain lipid lowering activity .
as a result , it will help to reduce the risk of repeated infections .
Development of a Basic Method for the Estimation of Rice Percentage in wheat / rice mixed Bakery Products
thus , bread produced from rice flour has gained popularity .
However , some bakery manufacturers are inclined to keep the percentage of rice low as bread produced from rice flour showed less mildness .
the contents were analyzed using DNA extraction method in which Polymerase Chain Reaction ( PCR ) is used .
using the Sodium Dudecyl Sulphate Poly Acrylamide Gel Electrophoresis ( SDS-PAGE ) , a quantitative calculation of the exact amount of protein present in the rice could be accurately expressed .
ITI ’ s Contribution to National Issues
DCD in imported milk powder
in early 2013 , it was reported that some brands of imported milk powder were contaminated with DCD .
though there is no evidence of the effect of DCD on human health , it is not acceptable to have any other substance in milk .
at the request of the Ministry of Technology and Research , ITI continued to develop a method to identify and quantify DCD compounds in milk powder and to analyze various vareities of milk powder .
more than 900 samples of milk powder were tested from August to December and the work was carried out continuously on the instructions of the government .
study on the quality of Well water in Rathupaswala area
a study was conducted by ITI on the request of the District Secretary , Gampaha to assess the pH reduction of well water in Rathupaswala area and to identify any possible relationship between pH reduction and the presence of effluent generated by a latex glove manufacturing factory , in the soil .
accuratly Identifying Wallapatta
Sri Lankan endemic Wallapatta plant is one of the most sought after plants in the world market for high quality perfumes .
in order to prevent the importation of the Wallapatta plants or the stems to other countries , there was a great need of accuratly identifying the data needed to verify this plants as well as the extracted resin of the plant .
currently , this method is being used by regulatory authorities in Sri Lanka to correctly identify plant species .
Technology Transfers
Automated Rain Gauge
Automated Rain Gauge developed by ITI is used to transfer rainfall quantity data accuratly and instantaneously using digital telecommunication technology .
since then , continuous improvement work has been carried out with field studies and equipment has been further developed to ensure its reliability and accuracy .
( Bt ) Bacillus to prevent fruit and vegetable related pests
it is generally known that Bacillus thuringiensis Bt bacteria are capable of controlling dengue mosquitoes .
it has been demonstrated that a local variety of Bt ( Kurstak Btk , a sub species of Bacillus thuringiensis ) can be used as a control to prevent damage caused by insects to fruits and vegetables .
the research project had been funded by Bio Power Lanka ( Pvt. ) Ltd .
subsequently the developed technology and the mother bacteria of Bt has been transferred to the same company for commercial use to advertised with required media .

ITI scientists are increasingly engaged mainly in the field of food , pharmaceuticals , materials and chemistry , primarily in consultancy services , contract , and high demand research activities .
membrane filtration and processing models to present fruits and vegetable juices as value-added products
using membrane filtration technology , pineapple , papaya , and beet root juice can be produced effectively with adequate nutritional value .
However , it has been seen that the large molecules can be broken down into smaller fractionated molecules by filtering through them to promote antioxidant and biological activity .
Laboratory tests have shown that enzymes can develop biologically active compounds by enzymatic hydrolysis done prior to filtration .
in the filtration process , a regular structural model was established while considering the theoretical objectives .
formulation of probiotic food as an alternative treatment for Helicobacter pylori infection
formulation of functional probiotic food as an alternative for antibiotics for treating Helicobacter pyroli infection was carried out .
snacks with rice bran flavoured with antioxidant properties
the main obstacle in producing rice bran favoured food is the rancidity occurs in about two days due to the lipase enzyme reaction .

Block Grants
the Block Grant is to meet recurrent expenditure needs of the provinces for the purpose of sustaining and improving the service delivery system .
salaries and wages of provincial staff approved by the Department of Management Services ( DMS ) constitute the major part of recurrent expenditure .
accordingly , the assessment of salaries and wages is calculated taking into account the actual living cadre within the approved staffing limit .
this grant also includes transfers to local authorities for meeting the expenditure on reimbursement of the allowances of members and salaries and wages of the staff .
( Allocation and Release of Block Grant during the period from 2010 to 2014 are given in the Annex I )
criteria Based Grant ( CBG )
the CBG is used to meet the capital expenditure for improving the socio-economic conditions of the people in a manner that contributes towards reducing regional disparities .
the funds provided under this grant are available to the provinces for discretionary spending on work related to development .
in 2016 , the Finance Commission made arrangements to allocate CBG funds into two categories , mentioned below .
I . Development Related Projects / Activities
these funds are expected to be utilized for development projects in the province .
II . special Projects proposed by Provincial Council Members
these funds are for the projects initiated by the Provincial Council Members .
( Allocation and Release of Criteria Based Grant during the period from 2010 to 2014 are given in the Annex II )
Province Specific Development Grant ( PSDG )
the PSDG is allocated mainly for financing development projects of capital nature .
this process is carried out paying special attention to infrastructure development under the devolved subjects .
the Finance Commission has allocated PSDG among selected development sectors and sub programmes under major sectors .
when provinces submit their development plans , they must recognize the provincial needs in line with the National Development Policy
Commission and respective provincial authorities discuss and agree to such plans .
for each investment item , measurable results ( output , outcome and impact ) need to be entered definitely .
for this , pre-defined indicators must be identified .
pre-defined indicators and periodical monitoring and evaluation on the achievements should be undertaken using such indicators .
all provincial authorities are expected to use the relevant formats introduced by the Finance Commission for results based monitoring and evaluation .
( Allocation and Release of Province Specific Development Grant 2010 – 2014 are in Annex 3 )
integrated Projects for Balanced Regional Development
a special allocation is provided under PSDG for the projects which can contribute remarkably to minimize inter and intra socio-economic disparities .
in the preparation of project proposals under this , increase in the value addition , creation of employment opportunities and reduction of poverty are expected to be given adequate attention .
Development of Under-served Villages
these allocations have been made under PSDG with the objective of investing in improving the basic facilities of the backward villages .
most of the villages are lagging behind due to lack of social and economic infrastructure facilities , environmental hazards and other social and cultural factors .
it is necessary that all such factors be given due attention and an integrated development approach be adopted in identifying projects and programmes .
only villages which are in the jurisdiction of Pradeshiya Sabhas should be identified under this funding category .
in selecting the villages , criteria like lack of income sources and inadequacy of common facilities need to be given due consideration .
projects for village development should be selected with the assistance of community .
village level committees which comprise public officers at rural level , representatives of community organizations , religious leaders and people represented at Pradeshiya Sabha levels are suggested to be established , at village level in order to facilitate the implementation of the projects .
depending on the nature of projects , the assistance of the relevant agencies in the province should be obtained in implementation .
the responsibility of implementation , monitoring and regulating the projects should be assigned to the Department / Unit which is responsible for the subject of rural development .
Flexible Amount
these funds allocated under PSDG should only be used to make adjustments in relation to sectors / agencies which are short of funds and to incorporate essential activities which are not included in the approved plan .
3 . methodology of Apportionment of Capital Funds between Provinces
the Finance Commission is responsible for formulating principles towards achieving balanced regional development in the country . in keeping with this objective , the Commission apportions capital funds ( PSDG and CBG ) between the provinces in a rationale manner .
in this regard , the Finance Commission uses a statistical methodology .
the Finance Commission has taken steps to allocate capital funds between the provinces on district basis in 2016 with the objective of ensuring fair distribution of funds for development in the province .
at the request of the Finance Commission , the Director General of the Department of Census and Statistics provided technical assistance to develop a statistical methodology for this purpose .
accordingly , the Department of Census and Statistics has appointed a team on this matter and they have developed a statistical formula .
in developing the formula , the following socio-economic variables have been considered .
factor
variable / Indicator
economic
X1 - Poverty Head Count Ratio
Health
X2 - No. of Hospital Beds per 1000 people
Education
X3 - Computer Literacy Rate ( % )
X4 - Percentage of difficult schools out of total provincial schools ( % )
infrastructure
X5 - Percentage of the length of roads to be developed out of total provincial road length ( % )
Agriculture
X6 - Paddy cultivated extent per square kilometer ( Acer / Km2 )
X7 - Average paddy yield ( Bushels per acre )
3.1 Methodology of Developing the Statistical Formula
this is to identify suitable proportions using the considered variables .
a multivariate statistical technique i.e. “ Principal Component Analysis ” ( PCA ) has been used to obtain a common score for the considered variable .
the coefficients of Principle Components ( PCs ) should not be multiplied by standardized form of variables owing to the above reasons .
but the variable per se cannot be used as they are in different scales .
all the variables have been adjusted by dividing them from their “ means ” and the variance of them is converted as coefficient of variance ( CV ) .
using the coefficients of first PC , the score ( Value of first PC ) for each district has been calculated based on the adjusted values of variables , divided by their mean . ( CV approach )
PC1 = a1 * X1 + a2 * X2 + … … … + a7 * X3
since the beneficiaries of the fund allocation are the people of the districts , the calculated scores above have been given weight according to the population of each district .
Finally , the weighted score of a district has been divided by the total weighted score and the proportion for each district has been calculated .
it is expected to improve the formula further , identifying new variables which represent the development levels of provinces in 2017 .
further , provinces have been allowed to adjust the district-wise allocations made in 2016 , if necessary .
the PSDG funds allocated by the General Treasury for 2016 have been apportioned between the provinces and districts based on the above formula .
the apportionment of funds at provincial and district levels have been basically done on the basis of the above proportions . However , considering some practical aspects like benefits of foreign and locally funded projects implemented at national level , sector priorities of districts , policy directions of the government and the revenue generated by each province , a few adjustments have been made in this exercise .
the CBG funds allocated by the General Treasury have also been apportioned between the provinces using the above formula and these funds have not been apportioned on district basis .
considering the number of council members in each province , separate amount of CBG has been apportioned to each province for use by them for development purposes .
the rest has been allocated for development projects of the province in general .
4 . provincial Revenue
provincial revenue originates from two main sources
I . transfer of Government Revenue
II . revenue Collected from Devolved Sources
4.1 Transfer of Government Revenue
according to the Fiscal Policy Circular No : 01 / 2010 , the national authorities , namely the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue , Director General of Customs and Commissioner General of Motor Traffic have been directed to transfer the collected revenue to the provinces on the following basis .
33 1 / 3 % of the Nation Building Tax ( NBT )
100 % of Stamp Duty
70 % of Vehicle Registration Fees
according to the Circular , collected NBT and stamp duty should be shared between the provinces fortnightly , using dedicated bank accounts according to the following percentages .
further re-fixing them periodically is carried out by the General Treasury , with the concurrence of the Finance Commission .

the figures in Table 01 show that lesser amounts have been transferred to the provinces , against the targeted amounts .
it is observed that the target on transfer of government revenue decided by the General Treasury needs to be re-visited , since there is a gap between the targets and actual transfers .
4.2 Revenue Collected from Devolved Sources
provincial revenue is collected through tax revenues and non-tax revenues as listed from 36.01 to 36.20 in the Ninth Schedule of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution .
some main sources of provincial revenue are , Motor Vehicle License Fees , Excise Duty , Stamp Duty and Court Fines .
Stamp Duty and Court Fines collected by provinces are annually transferred to the Local Authorities .
Stamp Duty constitutes the highest contribution of all the revenue sources . amounts collected through the main sources of provincial revenue in 2014 and 2015 ( up to June ) are given in Tables 2 and 3 .

basic principles of this process are as follows
a series of consultative meetings are held with the relevant provincial officers and a wide range of data and information on provincial development priorities , required service delivery and actual cadre are given due consideration
the Finance Commission submits its assessment of provincial fund requirements to the General Treasury
after consultation with the Finance Commission , the General Treasury agrees upon the bulk amount to be allocated for the provinces
the bulk amount is apportioned between the provinces , based on a set of criteria developed by the Commission
the constitutional provisions require the Finance Commission to submit its recommendations to H.E. the President with regard to principles of apportioning funds from the annual budget between provinces
5.1 Request for Provincial Capital and Recurrent Needs
the provincial authorities were requested to submit their recurrent needs for 2016 , in accordance with the “ Guidelines on Request of Funds ” issued by Finance Commission on 21st March , 2015 .
Recurrent expenditure consists mainly of two components .
this includes personal emoluments and other recurrent expenditure .

5.4 Financing Local Authorities
transfer of funds from provinces to local authorities for payment of salaries and allowances to approved living cadre and members is a major element of recurrent expenditure of local authorities .
at present , the total amount paid for salaries of the staff is reimbursed from the funds provided under the Block Grant .
some contract and casual cadre were previously paid by the collected revenue of the local authorities .
recently they were absorbed into the approved cadre .
hence , the total salary bill is paid by the funds transferred under the Block Grant .
it is recommended that the collected revenue by local authorities be utilized for the improvement of the service delivered to the public .
in addition , stamp duties and court fines transferred to local authorities by the provincial councils should be invested in development activities in the respective local authority areas .

6 . Aligning with National Policy
the major objective of the development policy of the Government is to continue the progress achieved by the country , as a nation of the “ middle income category ” and maintain 7 % -8 % of annual growth rate .
under the national policy titled “ Five Fold Policy ” , the Government has targeted to make a socio-economic revolution .
this includes five themes namely developing the economy , eradicating corruption , ensuring freedom , investing in infrastructure and improving education .
in this context , more attention has been paid in the government policy on increasing per-capita income , reducing income disparities between different income groups , minimizing socio-economic disparities at regional level and ensuring free education system through adopting the concept of “ social-market economy ” .
in this policy , particular attention has been paid to the contents included in the policy statements delivered by H.E. the President and Hon. Prime Minister before Parliament .
the Finance Commission has provided directives through guidelines to the provinces that they should prepare their Annual Development Plans in line with the above strategies at macro level .
6.1 Developing the Economy
developing the economy is one objective of the new development strategy of the Government .
as a measurement of the development , Sri Lanka has shown a higher level of achievement with regard to MDGs .
in future , Sri Lanka has agreed to work towards sustainable development under 17 Goals and 169 Targets declared by the United Nations at the Sustainable Development Summit .
among the goals to be achieved by 2030 , the followings are related to development of provinces .

the Finance Commission has already issued guidelines to the provinces in line with the above national strategies enabling them to prepare Annual Development Plans of provincial agencies .
the Finance Commission approves the projects of all provincial plans with a view to contributing to the development process of the country after careful evaluation .
the Commission abides by the following steps to increase the economic growth and achieve regional development in the country since 2016 .
Allocation of resources on district basis for minimizing the socio-economic disparities within the province . therefore , district-wise allocations will be made under PSDG from 2016
directing provinces to identify projects with community participation so as to minimize the development disparities based on the principles of ‘ demand driven approach ’ to minimize the intra-provincial disparities
promoting provincial authorities to undertake follow-up action with regard to implementation of projects and programmes contained in annual development plans
6.2 Eradication of Corruption
one of the main government policies is to eradicate corruption .
the Government expects to introduce legislation which will cover all forms of anti-corruption and anti-bribery .
pay attention on expenditure management .
the Finance Commission has brought attention of the provinces to the following aspects .
take measures to prevent pollution and adopt proper public expenditure management
adopt proper procurement procedures in the construction of buildings and use of buildings , vehicles , machinery and equipment in productive and optimal manner
6.3 Establishing a Strong Middle Class with Higher Income
current practice in the country makes the rich richer and the poor poorer .
therefore , the Government has given priority for the following key matters in order to change this situation and thereby enabling the country to graduate towards higher income stage .
I . promote self-employment and small scale entrepreneurs with the objective of creating jobs and generating income
II . make the middle class committed to economic development through empowerment of them
III . ensure food security through increasing food production at national level , based on homestead and village
iv . provide adequate assistance to vulnerable social groups and empower them
V. Determine salaries and wages taking into account the cost of living , in order to ensure higher living standards
the programmes on tourism , small and medium enterprises , agriculture and farming and women &apos;s development are suggested to be implemented to ensure benefittng the people at provincial level .
further , the Finance Commission has taken measures to promote self-employment and small scale entrepreneurs , after considering the contribution of informal sector to the national economy .
6.4 Improving Education
human resource is the most valuable resource in a country .
therefore , the Government has paid due attention to human resource development .
this is with a view to improving the labour force of the country to meet the demand in national and international labour markets .
in this context , the government has identified the following policies .
provide more facilities and incentives to all schools without discrimination
implement a special programme to provide safe drinking water and sanitary facilities to all schools where such facilities are not available
introduce a new School Education Act
establish National E – Libraries
increase investments in education to 6 % of GDP gradually
Finance Commission has allocated funds for the education sector in line with the above policies and issued guidelines on implementation of projects and programmes at provincial level .
following facts have been taken to consideration
I . completion of partially constructed school buildings and maintaining capital assets
II . provide common facilities including teachers &apos; quarters to solve the problem of shortage of teachers
III . transforming teacher education to higher levels / professionalizing educational services
iv . improving drinking water and sanitation facilities
V. Provide Guidance and facilities to dropout students to engage in vocational training
6.5 Investment in Infrastructure Facilities
priority has been given to invest in infrastructure facilities in line with the government policy on fivefold strategy .
therefore , much attention has been paid to the sectors of health , social welfare , transport , roads and housing .
the Finance Commission has issued guidelines to implement provincial development projects relating to these sectors adhering to the government policy .
the required provisions have also been made .
in the identification of projects , the provincial authorities are expected to pay attention to the following matter .
complete partially constructed hospital buildings and maintenance of capital assets
Construct quarters for doctors and para-medical staff so as to improve services of hospitals in difficult areas
procure and maintain medical equipment / machinery
prevent and control of diseases
improve primary health care in MOH areas

provide assistance to poor families to fulfill their housing needs
provide grants for needy families for improvement of their shelters based on Aided Self-Help Approach
Carpet and improve provincial ( C and D ) roads
Rehabilitate and maintain road related infrastructure
maintain bus stands including sanitary facilities
6.6 Enhancing the Revenue and New and Alternative Sources of Revenue for the Provincial Councils
transfer of revenue collected by the government and the revenue collected by the provincial councils from assigned sources of revenue are the two main sources of revenue in the provinces .
the Provincial Revenue List given in the 13th Amendment to the Constitution includes 21 sources of revenue to be collected by the provincial authorities .
the proportion of estimated revenue stands at 14.5 % of the total estimated expenditure of all provinces in 2016 , excluding the Western Province .
the proportion of estimated revenue is 51.9 % of the total estimated expenditure of the Western Province , in 2016 .
there is a high potential in the provinces to improve their revenue from the devolved sources , within the legal framework .
the new revenues should be earned from the assigned revenue sources which are not used so far .
for this purpose , the provinces should take measures to utilize their human and physical resources optimally .
further , it is necessary to encourage the local authorities to enhance their revenue capacity .
collection of revenue by local authorities is comparatively very low due to the failure of updating of statutes .
therefore , updating the relevant statutes is important because it has directly resulted in low income of the local authorities .
provincial Councils also transfer stamp duty and court fines to local authorities annually .
However , there should be a proper system to utilize them , since the manner in which they are spending them is unclear .
provincial Councils should adopt a novel approach to improve this revenue base while encouraging private sector to invest in commercial ventures .
following actions are very important in increasing the provincial income base .
I . facilitate private sector to invest at provincial level
in this effort , reducing bottlenecks on acquiring public and private lands , providing environmental and legal clearance in time , and providing skills development training to workers are of vital importance
II . need for an innovative approach to utilization of revenue
most of the provinces depend heavily on limited public funds provided by the General Treasury , based on the recommendations of the Finance Commission .
instead , it is important to enhance the provincial revenue from the devolved sources and utilize them in productive investments .
particularly , provincial authorities must take action not to limit revenue for recurrent expenditure but invest them in capital projects as well .
III . identifying development potentials at provincial level
all provinces have their own resource potentials which could be harnessed for development .
therefore , provinces have to identify such resource potentials which have comparative advantages , and take measures to use them by paving the way for increased value addition and improved revenue in provinces .
it is expected to enhance the provincial contribution to the GDP by implementing the above programs . the Finance Commission will coordinate with the Board of Investment , other relevant national agencies and the provincial authorities for realizing the objectives .
6.7 Adopting the Agency Results Framework Approach
the Finance Commission introduced the Agency Results Framework in the preparation of Medium-Term Plans for the provinces , based on Result Based Management Approach in 2013 .
accordingly , all provinces have prepared Medium-Term Agency Results Framework for a period of five years from 2013 to 2017 , and Annual Development Plans are implemented accordingly .
with the objective of ensuring investing public funds effectively and efficiently , the Zero Based Budgeting Approach has been introduced from 2016 onwards through Budget Circular No.3 / 2015 dated 29 / 07 / 2015 , issued by the Secretary to the Treasury .
hence , all provinces are requested to prepare a new Agency Results Framework for a period of three years from 2016 to 2018 in 2016 , based on the Zero Based Budgeting Approach taking into account , government policies and budget proposals .
a three-year Medium-Term Agency Results Framework should be prepared giving due consideration to experiences gathered during the past few years , Zero Based Budgeting concept and provincial development priorities .
the required forms will be provided with the guidelines for 2016 by the Finance Commission .
6.8 Establishment of an Effective Monitoring and Evaluation Mechanism
it is expected to evaluate the results of investments in terms of the Key Performance Indicators that have been developed in provincial Agency Results Frameworks .
the provinces have already been informed in this regard and the officers of the Commission will make field visits to provinces to carry out monitoring and follow-up actions .
6.9 Provincial Cadre and its Deployment Based on Institutional Roles and the Workload
the Department of Management Services , the National Pay Commission , relevant line Ministries and the Finance Commission have jointly prepared reports pertaining to optimum cadre of each spending agency of the provinces .
the optimum cadre required for delivering the service of each agency in efficient and effective manner has been determined accordingly .
even though , provinces have adequate cadre in general , it is evident that there is an excess cadre in the urban areas and a deficit in rural areas .
therefore , it is important to enforce the existing rules and regulations and manage the provincial cadre on a rational basis to avoid difficulties .
further , it is observed that the ratio of supporting staff is in an increasing trend compared with the staff grade positions in the entire cadre .
therefore , proper systems and norms should be introduced to overcome this unfavorable situation .
7 . Conclusion
according to the policy statements of H.E. the President and Hon. Prime Minister , mid-term annual growth rate has been targeted between 7 % - 8 % .
in the achievement of this growth rate at macro level , the contribution made by the provinces is vital .
as far as the provincial contribution to GDP is concerned , the impact of the Western Province is around 43 % .
However , during the past five year period , this contribution has decreased from 45 % to 43 % showing a positive trend .
the least contributed Northern Province has shown a increasing trend of its share of GDP from 2.4 % to 4 % , the reason being the special development activities undertaken in the area in the recent past .
when the indices like Poverty Ratio , Unemployment Rate , Prosperity Index , Infant Mortality Rate , Computer Literacy Rate , Student and Drop-out Ratio are considered , a positive change can be observed in all the provinces .
in addition , when the criteria such as the use of durable household items , quality of houses , safe drinking water and supply of electricity are taken into consideration , an appreciable favorable trend is observable .
However , it is worthwhile to mention that implementation of special programmes and projects focused on minimizing intra-provincial socio-economic disparities should be paid further attention .
it is also necessary to give due consideration to achievement of Sustainable Development Indices , declared by the United Nations in carrying out future planning .
the Finance Commission has already taken measures to fulfill the Constitutional Mandate of achieving balanced regional development in the country , and special allocations have been made towards realizing this objective .
guidelines have been given to the provinces with regard to implementation of special projects with the assistance of private sector , aiming at reduction of intra-provincial socio-economic disparities . these projects should be capable of improving value addition and generating income avenues in the respective project areas .
the Finance Commission has also taken steps to ensure utilization of resources effectively by adopting Results Based Management approach and Zero-Based Budgeting .
Although recurrent expenditure of the provinces constitutes a very high rate of 80 % , the expenditure in the sectors of education , health and agriculture can be viewed as investments in the promotion of human capital .
the other notable factor in this regard is that the provinces provide manpower required for implementation of programmes and projects by most of the agencies at national level .
8 . way Forward
the guidelines and circulars in this regard will be issued to provinces by the Commission .
further , measures will be taken to allocate financial provisions on district basis in order to strengthen the mandate of reducing intra-provincial development disparities .
in the allocation of funds between the districts and sectors , a statistical methodology taking into account socio-economic indicators reflecting the regional disparities will be adopted .
further , in this exercise the practical aspects like specific potentials at provincial level and benefits according to the provinces from foreign funded projects will be paid required attention .
through these measures , it is expected to create an environment which will lead to utilize the allocated funds to provinces in an optimal manner , thus enabling the public to fulfill their aspirations .
it is also imperative to maintain an optimal cadre to suit the provincial needs . there is a pre-requisite to manage recurrent expenditure in proper manner .

domestic Elders Care Service - Training Program
the National Elders Secretariat has launched a program to train and employ volunteers to provide elders care and nursing service for the elderly .
a total of 135 selected persons have been given three weeks of formal training in providing care and health services for the elderly .
the elders , especially those in need , living in the Western Province , have been given the valuable opportunity to obtain their services .
for this , an 8-hour shift during the day will cost Rs . 600.00 .
the service is provided under the full supervision of the National Secretariat for Elders and a male or female care giver can be employed depending on the requirement of the client .
also , all employees employed in the service are subject to an Elders Care Ethics System .
the Ministry of Social Services and the Ministry of Health jointly design and conduct the training program and issue a formal certificate and identity card to the trainees who successfully complete the training .
therefore , they have been able to obtain the services of the volunteers with the utmost confidence .
this program has benefited not only the elderly and their families , but also the elderly care volunteer trainees who are able to earn an income by becoming an independent caregiver after receiving a government certified training .
Although the Elderly Care Volunteer Service is currently based in the Western Province , it is envisaged to expand it in order to provide a broader service to the elderly by extending it to other provinces in the future .
Elder Cover Sponsorship Scheme
as proposed by the National Council for Elders , the National Elders Secretariat has launched this Elder Cover Sponsorship Scheme with a view to assisting the elderly persons over 70 years of age who have been destitute due to poverty .
Anyone can donate money for this program .
the donated money is granted to the poor and needy elders selected at the Divisional Secretariat level , at the rate of Rs . 250 / - per month .
when funding those beneficiaries , once in four months , Rs . 1000 / - is given to the Divisional Secretariat for each beneficiary .
the beneficiary will be given the money through the Divisional Secretariats .
one of our officers at the Divisional Secretariat ( Elders Rights Promotion Assistant / Social Services Officer ) will look into these beneficiaries every three months and inform the donor whenever money is given to the beneficiaries .
also , when donating money through this programme , the donor has the ability to choose one or more beneficiaries or to name one or more beneficiaries from regions they select .
otherwise , the selection will be made by this office and it will provide the details of the beneficiary &apos;s name and address to the donor .
those who wish to contribute to this program can make a donation to the Elders Coverage Foster Account No. 5234881 of Bank of Ceylon , Battaramulla .
upon donating money a copy of the deposit receipt should be sent to us .
in the alternative , you can come to our office and donate your money .
since this is a meritorious act towards the elderly , this program is intended to serve a large number of elderly people .
accordingly , the donors , beneficiaries and the relevant Divisional Secretariats of the Elders Coverage Foster program in the year 2013 are given below .

Ceylon Shipping Corporation Ltd Annual Reports and the Statement of Accounts
Chairman ’ s Review for the year 2012 / 1013
I am pleased to report that significant progress has een made during the period under review .
CSCL has made an exceptional progress by achieving an after tax profit of Rs . 218.79 million compared to that of Rs . 84.20 million recorded in the previous year .
this shows a record growth of profit by 159 % year on year .
this significant progress was made by CSCL in a backdrop of a bleak industry scenario , where generally all market segments of the shipping industry continued to experience a setback , mainly due to excess of supply more than the demand for shipping services .
the impact of the economic recession doomed in the year 2008 continues to be felt in the shipping industry .
the much awaited recovery to pre-recession level has yet to be materialized despite the expectations of the Industry Analysts .
during the period under review , CSCL was able to achieve a total turnover of Rs . 850.7 million , which is a healthy increase of 150 % compared to that of Rs . 339 million in the previous year .
it should be noted that the business segment of coal transportation accounts substantially with the contribution of Rs . 237.7 million to the total turnover .
the decision taken by the management of CSCL during the period under review to re-arrange the coal transport contract , which was effective from the year 2010 in order to obtain more economical benefits has been noteworthy and contributed to exceptional increase of the turnover and the quantum of profit .
the Basic Earnings Per Share during the period under review amounts to Rs . 43.76 as against that of Rs . 16.84 in the previous year recording a substantial increase of 159.8 % year on year .
in view of the exceptional profit made during the period under review , an interim dividend of Rs . 10.0 million was paid to the Department of Public Enterprises of the General Treasury which is the sole shareholder of CSCL .
the two ships owned by CSCL , namely Lanka Mahapola and Lanka Muditha , which were not suited for any economically viable commercial operation due to their age were sold .
action initiated to purchase new ships with the assistance of the Government is being continuously pursued .
an agreement was signed to build two bulk carriers for the carriage of coal .
this was funded by a commercial loan issued by a local state bank with the Government Guarantee .
in considering the future outlook , it is of critical importance that CSCL being the National Carrier of the country secures exclusive right of sea transportation of bulk commodities such as coal , crude oil and fertilizers being imported to the country .
on the long term basis , eventually this assisted CSCL to build up its own fleet of ships and also long term chartering of ships in order to fulfill the very objectives that the Corporation has been established for .
serving the external trade of the country and assisting the Sea Training aspect of the aspirant seafarers by offering &apos; on-board the vessel &apos; training opportunities remains the foremost objectives of CSCL .
it should be mentioned that the assistance being offered by the Government in this regard has been encouraging .
it is also essential that CSCL further enhance its revenue from general cargo transportation operations based on buying and selling of space and slots on third party ships operating in the international trade , by securing more state sector cargo to CSCL fold , which are now being carried by foreign Shipping Companies .
CSCL should also make use of the opportunities in alternative segments such as bunkering , coastal services , common user warehousing etc . , which are now been facilitated and encouraged under the Government policy of developing the country as the Maritime Hub .
CSCL continued to look after its employees by contributing to their welfare .
they also sponsor their training programs and professional study courses empowering them with updated knowledge and skills .
the contribution made by the employees of CSCL to achieve the noteworthy progress by their hard work and dedication is commendable and appreciated .
in conclusion , I take this opportunity to appreciate and thank the Board of Directors , our Line Ministry , all our customers , business partners , agents and all other stakeholders for their continued support and cooperation extended to CSCL and looking forward to their enhanced partnerships and patronage in the coming year as well .
Ceylon Shipping Corportion Ltd Annual Reports and the Statement of Accounts
Directors Report for the Annual Report 2012 / 2013
CSCL continued with the process to purchase new ships in pursuance of the recommendation received from the National Planning Department of the General Treasury in response to the feasibility study submitted by CSCL for acquisition of ships .
action is now being pursued with the relevant Government agencies to initially build two 63,600 MT DWT vessels in China for transportation of thermal coal being imported to the country by the Ceylon Electricity Board .
one of the two ships owned by CSCL , namely M.V. Lanka Muditha continued to be in laid-up status in the Port of Galle while the tender process was in progress for its disposal .
the other owned ship , M.V. Lanka Mahapola was on bareboat charter .
the Charterer was in breach of charter party agreement , which has been referred for arbitration .
actions were being followed up to take the redelivery of the ship from the defaulting Charterer .
CSCL continued to serve its business on the general cargo liner sector hiring space on third party vessels on NVOCC basis .
the main cargo base has been the government cargoes offered to CSCL under the existing Public Finance Circular No : FIN 415 , to and from places all over the world during the year under review .
whilst performing the service CSCL was able to achieve a considerable increase in the tonnage of almost all types of imports including Pure Car Carrier services as well as Break Bulk cargo service .
this shows a significant improvement in its volumes as against the previous year .
However , volumes of FCL and LCL export tonnage have shown a drastic reduction as against the previous year .
CSCL NVOCC services handled cargo from USA , Canada , UK and all European destinations , Scandinavian port , Russian ports , Brazil , Mexico , South Africa , Slovenia , Ukraine , Mediterranean , Arabian Gulf , Far East , East Asia , Australia , New Zealand &amp; Indian sub continent ports etc .
during the period under review break bulk and pure car carrier volumes have been increased more than almost threefold compared to the previous year .
However , LCL tonnage and container movements in TEUs have decreased by 25.93 % &amp; 20.88 % respectively compared to the previous year .
the period under review is the 3rd Contract Year of the Contract of Affreightment signed between CSCL and the Lanka Coal Company ( Pvt ) Ltd. in March 2010 .
it is valid until March 2014 , for the transportation of coal for the Lakvijaya Power Station of the Ceylon Electricity Board .
CSCL lifted a total quantity of 761,281 MT during the six month window period excluding South West monsoon season .
a notable feature in this year is the deployment of self-propelled barges replacing dumb barges .
this resulted in a drastic improvement of the productivity in coal discharging and lightering in the port of Puttalam .

Conducting Pre-retirement Programme - 2012
elderly Home Care Service - Training Programme
National Secretariat for Elders has initiated a programme to train and employ elder protection voluntary workers with the intention of providing care and nursing services needed for elders .
accordingly , a group of 135 selected persons were given a systematic training for three weeks , on looking after and providing health services for elders and by now precious opportunity has emerged especially for those elders living in the Western province with the requirement of such a service , to obtain the services of these trained personal .
to provide this service , for an eight-hour shift during the day time , only a fee of Rs . 600 / = will be charged .
this service is provided under the complete supervision of the National Secretariat for Elders and depending on the nature of the required service of receivers , services of a female or a male service provider can be obtained .
also , all the elder caregivers that are employed will work according to a code of ethics .
the training programme has been planned and operated jointly by the Ministry of Social Services and the Ministry of Health .
a proper certificate and an identity card will be issued for those who complete the training successfully .
therefore , obtaining the services of elder protection voluntary workers with more confidence has become possible .
as a result of this programme not only the elders and their families but also those who have been trained as elder protection voluntary workers have been benefited .
they can now own a government recognized valuable certificate after going through a training and earn an income by working as an independent caregiver .
Although the functioning of this Elder Protection Voluntary Service is presently centred around the Western province , it is intended to provide a broader service to the elders who require such a service by spreading this service to the other provinces in the future .

Report of the Auditor General on the Financial Statement of the National Secretariat for Elders for the year ended as at 31 st December 2012 in accordance with the Section 14 ( 2 ) ( C ) of the Financial Act No. 38 of 1971
2.2 Expressing the views on Financial Statements
2.2.1 Accounting Deficiencies
( a ) Number of vehicles belongs to the institution as at 31 December 2011 listed as follows .
( a ) The depreciation of vehicles of QI – 5819 and KR – 1128 is the cause for the variation pointed out in the audit .
the depreciation document of QI – 5819 states that this three-wheeler was purchased in the year 2010 .
at the time of inspecting the registration documents of this three-wheeler , following details could be identified .
first registration date of this vehicle is 08 . 01 . 2007 .
at that time , this vehicle was called “ Help age Sri Lanka ” .
the said vehicle was transferred to the institution on the day of 19.05.2011 .
accordingly , depreciation of this vehicle should be done for six years from 2007 to 2012 .
having rectified all these details , it has been noted for the correction through previous year adjustment account at the preparing of the final accounts for 2013 .
the registration date of KP – 1128 vehicle was 18 . 11 . 2011 .
in spite of the vehicle was purchased in 2011 , depreciation had not been done for about one month and in the purchasing year .
further , even though the vehicle had been purchased in 2011 , this vehicle was started to run in the year of 2012 , so depreciation in terms of 2011 is seen to be unpractical .
in consequence , you are informed that the depreciation amounts are correct .
accordingly , the additional amount of Rs . 435,000 / - , which was noted down in the Net Assets has been received from the Rs . 460,000 / - of the KP 1128 vehicle .
this was caused by not being depreciated the vehicle in 2011 and further depreciation of the vehicle QI – 5819 for an extra year .
Reference to the vehicles , I must mention hereby that the KR - 1128 vehicle had been registered on 30th November 2011 and was started to run in the year of 2012 , and Therefore , there is no need of being depreciated the vehicle .
since the vehicle QI-5819 has been purchased in 2007 and is further depreciated , I am kindly informed that this adjustment was recorded in the preparation of the final accounts for 2013 .
( B ) Presentation of the Account
( I ) An account is being maintained to help needy elders called “ Sponsorship Scheme for Elders ” ( Wedihiti Awarana Kepakaru ) .
following transactions were made in this account in the year of 2012 .
balance of the final account as at 31.12.2011
receipt of the year as at 31.12.2011
payments During the Year as at 31.12.2011
balance as at 31.12.2011
( II ) The remaining balance of Rs . 104,614 / - from the amount of the World Health Organization is a current liability .
all liabilities in the final account ( as current assets and liabilities ) have been given together .
officers were instructed to alter these details in due course .
( D ) Bank Accounts
( I ) It was observed that unidentified credits have been included in the bank reconciliation report and these have not been included in our Cash Book .
it should be inquired from the bank to check what this money is .
inquiries have already made from Bank of Ceylon , in this regard .
having revealed the information regarding these deposits properly , this would be added to the revenue .
( II ) Accounting of each year has been calculated after paying the bank charges of one year .
but , in the year of 2013 , these bank charges have been calculated monthly .
a bank charge for the month of July 2013 has been also accounted .
arrangements have been made not to do such shortcomings in future
( III ) Donors directly credit to the bank account number of the “ Sponsorship Scheme for Elders ” ( Wedihiti Awarana Kepakaru ) as the propaganda activities have been done to request the money from donors and deposit it directly to the bank .
once this is identified , the receipts will be issued and accounted .
therefore , having identified the amount of this money in January 2013 , it has been given in the accounts .
Mrs. Shanthi Hinted has deposited the amount of this money in the bank .
( e ) The voucher no . 63 and dated 15 of October 2012 is a cheque prepared to pay the payment to a private electricity company for electricity .
as the electricity was disconnected at the time of issuing the cheque , the owner has paid the money and presented the receipt .
at the time of making the payments , he has paid Rs . 50,750 / - including the disconnection charges .
the cheque amounted Rs . 49,721 / - written by us was cancelled and a receipt was issued .
the payment was not deleted from the Ledger Accounts .
total electricity expenditure of the year amounted Rs . 858,868 . 50 was calculated also including this amount of money .
therefore , it has been calculated in the account correctly .
( f ) Electricity bill of Kataragama Elders Home amounted to Rs . 2,702 / - has been mistakenly included as an office electricity bill .
the officers have been made aware of not to do such mistakes hereinafter .
( g ) Prior identification in which to check whether the vouchers were presented in the last year for the payments which were already paid as accrued expenses has not been done and since the overtime , holiday pay , travelling pay were expensed in the month of December , they were not taken as accrued expenses .
the overall result of these expenses is not changing as these expenses are incurred systematically in each year .
the officers have been made aware of not to do such mistakes hereinafter .
( h ) Journal entry notes in the accounts of 2012 re notes made by the accountant himself .
the Signing had not been made and having pointed out it in the audit , it was signed by him .
notes related to the journal entry of 21 and 29 have been neglected to make .
this fault was rectified and arrangements have been made not to do such shortcomings in future .
( I ) The essential payments had been delayed due to not receiving the necessary imprest properly in 2012 .
electricity bill was also a result of not receiving the necessary imprest properly from the Treasury .
therefore , I must inform that we had to pay the penalty for the delay .
( j ) The Shroff was instructed to maintain the register for stamps and it has been maintained since 2013 .
( k ) Entering in the Ledger incorrectly
( I ) Separate object was not introduced for bank charges until 2012 and it was debited to the object of postal and electricity for years .
Bank charges were debited to a separate subject since 2013 .
( II ) It has been brought to accounts by mistake .
arrangements have been made not to do such shortcomings in future .
( III ) It has been brought to accounts by mistake .
arrangements have been made not to do such shortcomings in future .
2.3.2 Unreconciled Control Accounts
having identified the balance of Rs . 50,800 / - , which was brought forward in the final account of 2011 was incorrect , Journal entry note 31 has been used to credit Rs . 8,800 / - of the Festival Advance Account , by having debited the previous year Adjustment Account .
payments and Receipts of 2012 are listed below as per the note .
Festival Advance Account
balance brought forward
payment for the year 2012
previous year Adjustment Account
charging for the year 2012
balance brought below
However , the list related to the balance of this account of Rs . 62,500 / - is indicated as Rs . 61,500 / - ( Annex 01 ) .
since the actual value of the initial balance as at 31.12 . 2012 should be Rs . 41,000 / - , Rs . 9,800 / should be debited to the previous year &apos;s adjustment account , but this should not be Rs . 8,800 / - .
this fault has been noted down to rectify at the time of preparing the final account 2013 .
( B ) Balance of the Flood Advance Account as at 01.01.2012 was Rs . 130,390.96 and the balance at 31.12.2012 was Rs . 32 , 597.48 .
this amount of money was included under the current assets of the balance sheet as at 31 . 12 . 2012 .
the amount charged during the year – Rs . 97 , 793 . 48 / -
accordingly , the final balance is also correct .
( C ) Separate ledger was maintained for advances since many previous years .
such account has not been maintained in the main ledger .
However , the actions were taken to maintain a separate ledger page for this purpose , after this had been pointed out in the audit .
( D ) Having rectified the balance as at 31.12.2012 in the final account as it was mentioned incorrectly , it has been rectified too in the bank reconciliation .
arrangements have been made to avoid such shortcomings in the future .
( e ) Receipts of flood installments have been indicated in the pages 412 and 413 of the ledger .
it is also proved as per the answer written in the Note ( a ) .
a separate page for the distressed loan has not been maintained up to now .
this detail has been included in the CC 10 document .
the alance of the distressed loan account is equal to the balance of the absolute balance list .
( f ) Though it has been mistakenly indicated as Rs . 55,315 / - when calculating the balance in the ledger , the correct balance was Rs . 59,705 / - .
this value has been brought to accounts correctly .
( g ) Overtime expenditure of December 2012 has not brought to accounts as accrued expenditure as at 31.12.2012 .
However , the total value of the ledger was rectified as Rs . 434,119 . 87 / - .
2.2.3 Lack of Evidence for Audit
( a ) Furniture - 7,644,348 / -
this is the total value of the fixed assets located in the National Secretariat for Elders and Divisional Secretariats .
2 . machinery and Equipment - Rs . 2,441,309 / -
having educated the officers to work as above ( i ) , it will be functioned from the current year .
( B ) Advances not cleared - Rs . 1000 / -
this has been investigated and this has been caused by a delay in accounting for 2011 .
this correction was made in August 2013 .
( C ) Telephone Bills - Rs . 429,579 / -
actions have been taken since 2013 to maintain a separate document for each phone , to pay the telephone bills according to the maximum limits , and to charge from the salaries of the officers whose phone bills exceed the maximum limits .
( D ) Payments - Rs . 404,700 / -
( answers will be prepared after the information received through the investigation . )
( e ) For this purpose , actions will be taken to obtain these details by sending a letter of reminder to the subject officer .
( f ) Action will be taken to collect the receipt by reminding in connection with the amount of money sent to Divisional Secretariats .
( g ) Issue of Advances – Rs . 119,500 / -
advances would not be released without receiving the approved estimations .
( h ) Renovation of Elders ’ Homes – Rs . 225,000 / -
( answers will be prepared after receiving information through the investigation )
2.2.4 Non – compliance with Laws , Rules , Regulations and Management Decisions
( I ) Section 3 . 7 of the Chapter XXIV of the Establishment Code – Rs . 150,000 / -
at the time of applying for the loan , vouchers are prepared immediately after receiving the application forms for this purpose and are recorded in the festival advance register , but the payments are made thereinafter .

( I ) Financial Regulations
F. R. 225 ( 1 ) – Rs . 638,862 / -
subject officers were educated to maintain the file correspondence properly .
they were instructed to be keen on in preparing the vouchers henceforth .
( II ) F. R. 371 ( 2 ) ( c ) – Rs . 105,000 / -
( once the information is submitted , the answers will be prepared . )
F. R. 396 – Rs . 60,846 / - not dealing with the cheques exceeded six ( 06 ) months
having sent the letters to all receivers of cheques which exceeded the six ( 06 ) months , cheques were extended and the correspondence in connection with the checks issued to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue is in the process .
after issuing the last notification , these cheques were credited to the state revenue by means of clearance the cheques , while the actions will be taken in September 2013 in related to the rest of cheques .
( III ) Procurement Guideline 2006 – Rs . 163,500 / -
under the delegation of financial authority in which the Secretary of the Minister holds it , the Director of the National Secretariat for Elders has been vested the authority of issuing the amount of Rs . 250,000 / - .
a copy of the same is attached herewith .
accordingly , the amount of Rs . 163,500 / - has been subjected to the aforesaid delegation of financial authority .
3.1 Financial Result
financial deficiency of the year of 2012 is Rs . 12,176,526 / - .
the reasons for the increase in the deficiency in the financial results more than the previous year are the following matters which are beyond the control .
1 . not receiving Grants from the Government - Rs . 9,744,471 / -
2 . increase in personal salaries and wages - Rs . 6,696,701 / -
3 . increase in the operating expenses - Rs . 177,534,680 / -
not receiving predicted government grants was beyond the control .
private salaries have been increased due to new recruitments of 08 officers to the service in 2012 , expenditure incurred for the payment of salaries for them and payments of inter allowances ( in terms of circulars ) .
an increase in the operating expenses is caused by the payment of Rs . 1000 / - allowance to senior citizens .
However , I wish to inform that all these expenses are beyond the control .
every attempt will be practiced in minimizing the expenditure .
3.2 Analyzed Financial Review
the main reason for the increase in accrued expenses was the lack of adequate imprest in December 2012 .
therefore , the payments for vouchers over Rs . 9 Million related to the year 2012 had to be paid in 2013 .
4 . operating Review
4.1 Performance
I . Establishment of Elders Committees at Village Level
even though 570 Elders Committees should have been established as per the annual action plan , only 378 have been established .
it has been printed as 516 in the progress report due to a printing mistake .
II . issue of Identity Cards
in view of that , the total amount is Rs . 17,119 / -
III . day Care Centres for Elders
financial assistance has been extended for 17 Day Care Centres during the year 2012 .
even though the expected target here is 36 , the target could not be achieved due to lack of provisions received .
iv . printing Affairs
amended Act
despite the fact that 5000 copies were expected to print , it was not printed as the necessity to do so did not arise .
Annual Reports
they were printed upon the official needs .
Elders Identity Cards
Although they had not been calculated , they were printed upon the service need .
V. Conducting of Medical Clinics , issue of Eye Lenses and Assistive Devices
the target could not be achieved due to lack of financial provisions and an amount of Rs . 5 . 212 Million had been spent at the end of the year 2012 .
However , an amount of money to be paid had been also remained .
vi . commemoration of the International Elders Day
total expenditure was Rs . 1 . 013 Million .
even though this amount is correct , the expenditure incurred by Thelijja Sri Lanka Institute has not been included in the expenditure file and therefore , the amount was shown as Rs . 0.791Million .
vii . Board Meetings
financial progress of the Annual Progress Report has been indicated as 0.733 by mistake .
( a ) Financial Assistance for Elders Committee
I . financial assistance of Rs , 5,000 / - each for 378 Village Level Elders Committees and Rs . 7,500 / - each for 09 Divisional Level Elders Committees were given in 2012 .

( II ) The data had to be collected from 331 Divisional Secretariats in all over the country and this programme had to be conducted quickly .
applications were sent to the National Secretariat for Elders as per the information received .
sending the application from time to time to the bank was not practicable and the applications received at last to office were retained as those have exceeded the closing date of accepting the applications .
( III ) These programmes were national level programmes and it was not easy to do this task with the other daily task of the National Savings Bank in a short period of time .
they had to work hard for a few months in this regard .
Withal , the applications were received once in a while from 331 Divisional Secretariats to the Head Office and in view of that , they were forwarded to the bank .
at that juncture , the payments had to be made on several occasions and the allowance for the month of June 2012 had to be paid until October .
( iv ) In implementing this programme , provisions had been received only to the month of July in terms of making the payments through the related banking books .

However , there was only an agreement between the Director of the Department of Social Services and the Director of the National Secretariat for Elders .
due to the prevailing situation , action has been taken to hand over the property to the department as the elders home cannot be started using the said land and the building .
accordingly , the National Elders Secretariat will not be held responsible anymore for said property .
5.3 Budget Control
the large variation of 12 % - 374 % between the budgetary document and actual income-expenditure has been caused by the monthly allowance of Rs . 1000 / - paid to senior citizens .
this is not an estimated expense .
the Ministry had also offered some amount of money to the National Secretariat for Elders for this purpose .
this work had to be done promptly in accordance with Mahinda Chinthana programme , hence , this programme was implemented immediately without any prior preparation .

Chairman &apos;s Review
I am pleased to present you the Audited Financial Statements and the Annual Report of Lanka Logistics &amp; Technologies Ltd. for the year ended on March 31 , 2012 .
during the year , the company continued to operate with the primary objective of facilitating procurement of goods and services to the Armed Forces &amp; the Police in particular for purchases made through bilateral agreements with the Russian , Indian and Chinese Governments .
in fulfilling this responsibility , the company assured the swift and timely delivery of goods and services while maintaining confidentiality and reliability .
in the process , the company was entitled to an administration fee of Rs . 63.9 million .
However , considering the Financial Expenditure Heads made available to the Armed Forces a sum of Rs . 63.9 million was recognized as revenue during the year under review .
the inability to collect the receipts from the Armed Forces &amp; the Police hindered the implementation of the Cabinet approved Private / Public Joint Venture Project for the establishment of a Military Grade Footwear Manufacturing Facility .
under the circumstances , the Company could have earned only a Net Profit After Tax of Rs . 6.2 M during the year under review .
in conclusion , I express my sincere thanks to my colleagues in the Board of Directors for the expertise , guidance , and support given .
I also take this opportunity to express my sincere appreciation to the management and staff led by Mr. Jayantha Wickramasinghe , the Chief Executive Officer , for their dedication and commitment which enabled the company reaches its corporate objectives .

with a view to accomplish sustainable development goals through such exercise there should be a peaceful ambience in place both externally and internally .
the prevalence of sustainable peace throughout the country is an essential aspect in steering a country towards its sustainable development and in continuing to maintain the development so achieved .
Nelson Mandela too has once said , “ Peace is the prime weapon of development ” and it is therefore apparent that the prevalence of sustainable peace is really vital for a country to prosper .
as such , our Ministry under whose charge the safeguarding of law and order in this country lies has been entrusted with an onus of great responsibility .
one of the main obstacles against the maintenance of long lasting peace in Sri Lanka was the gruesome terrorism that caused havoc on the socio economic fabric of the country over a period of almost thirty years .
through the humanitarian operation that got underway in parallel to peace initiative towards the consolidation of law and order , peace was ushered in by salvaging the entire country including the North and the East from terrorism .

II . crimes against Women and Children
III . vehicular Accidents
iv . crimes related to Excise and Drugs
V. Prevention of Corruption and Raids

Ministry of Law and Order - Annual Performance Report 2014
taking into account of the number of reported cases classified according to the nature of crimes as a whole , a gradual decrease is evident in such cases except for the slight increase in the reported minor offences in 2013 and the reported petty complaints in 2014 .
grave crimes include 21 types of such crimes whilst under the category of minor offences , the number of offences against persons and the number of offences against properties is 15 and 11 respectively .

the percentage of resolving grave crimes increased to 59 % in the year 2013 from 54 % in 2012 recording an increase of 9.3 % and the position continued to be the same in the year 2014 by making it possible to resolve 58 % of the reported crimes .
a very high proportion of the reported grave crimes consists of burglary , theft of bicycles , theft of cattle and theft of properties including plantation items over Rs.5,000.00 in value .
the percentage involving minor offences resolution against persons reported in 2014 was 72 % .
even though it showed a 1 % decline in comparison to the year 2013 ( 73 % ) , the 7 % progress in resolutions achieved in 2013 as against 2012 ( 68 % ) was a continuation of such exercise .
despite the fact that there solution of minor offences against properties reflected an 11 % decrease in comparison to the relevant resolution progress of 61 % in 2013 , it is evident that there is a resolution rate of 53 % compared to the number of such cases reported .
recorded petty complaints in connection with intimidation , assault , family disputes , land disputes and disputes over cash and kind are on an upward trend .
in the case of such reported petty complaints , the Department of Police has been able to maintain a resolution percentage of 99.5 % , 99.7 % and 99.6 % as against the years 2012 , 2013 and 2014 respectively .
in regard to crime resolution percentage of all types of crimes , the Department has been able to register a crime resolution rate of 96 % as against the projected rate of 60 % in 2014 .

II . rate of the grave crimes taking place in the country is on a noticeable downturn
III . resolution of crimes is on a gradual increase as against reported crimes
iv . maintenance of a very high resolution rate in regard to petty complaints every year
4.2 Crimes against Women and Children
prevention of crimes committed against women and children is of paramount importance in building a society free of crimes and violence .
Sri Lanka Police , under the guidance and direction of the Ministry mindful of the specifically focused concern over this situation by both the national as well as international communities , set a host of programmes and projects in motion to good effect in collaboration with other related stakeholders .
Meanwhile , the activities carried out by various institutions as well as by Bureaus for Children and Women set up in all the police stations islandwide to educate people on the abuse of children , household violence and crimes committed against children and women , and to conduct various programmes of activity , refer the victims to systematic rehabilitation and to strengthen the Bureaus for Children and Women in police stations were really noteworthy .

a slight increase in reported crimes against children and women is evident and the upward trend in crimes against women has apparently given rise to this situation in comparison to the period of three years that proceeded .
However , in comparison to such situation , the progress in resolutions which stood as 24 % in 2012 has been able to see an increase up to 42 % in the year 2014 .
this has been made possible by the progress in resolutions concerning crimes against children up to an increase of 28 % and also by the progress in resolutions concerning crimes against women up to an increase of 52 % .
4.3 Vehicular Accidents
one of the key tasks in the maintenance of law and order in such a manner as to provide protection to lives and properties of the people of this country is the proper control of vehicular traffic on roads .

11 . summary of progress
when observing the percentage rates achieved in the reporting of crimes and their resolution it is evident that there is a far better growth in the measures taken to realize the goal of establishing law and order in the country during the first three quarters of 2014 .
towards the end of the year 2014 , this achievement reflected the potential to reach the expected level of performance realizing the annual targets within the mid-term expenditure framework .

Performance Report 2014
the Department of External Resources
overall Analysis
the Department of External Resources mobilises and manages external financing needed for the acceleration of the country &apos;s economic growth while maintaining long term debt sustainability of the country .
maintaining adequate levels of public investment is essential for achieving the Sustainable Economic Development Goals and reducing the gap between the domestic savings and investment .
foreign Development Cooperation is very important as receiving credit and grants from bilateral and multilateral development partners to meet the development needs of the country .
these development assistance grants have been awarded to Sri Lanka as credits with longer maturities and low or no interest and mixed credits ( loan and grant combined ) .
those funds were invested in conducting projects in the areas of poverty reduction , economic infrastructure development in education , health , electricity and energy , water supply , roads and bridges , internal transport , aviation , and in the areas of agriculture , irrigation and environmental protection .
the composition of the external development financing has substantially changed over the last few years with the gradual increase of per capita income of the country .
with the reduction of concessional foreign financing , steps have been taken to broaden the options on fulfilling the funds for public investment in the country .
the attention was paid to fulfill the foreign financing requirements with a proper mix of non-concessional or less concessional loans and with the available concessional financing .
under this new development strategy , China and India have emerged as two lead development partners while the ADB , IDA , and Japan are maintaining their support as in the past .
with higher per capita income level , the financing assistance based on the Western bilateral concessional conditions has been diminished while financing in the form of export credits show a growth .
Similarly , the ADB has reduced the amount of concessionary loan funds available to the country and it shows an increment in supplying the non-concessional financing facilities .

Department of External Resources
Russia , Australia , and the Western Division
the Economic Development Division of the Department of External Resources collects official development assistance from countries in the Western Hemisphere to achieve Sri Lanka &apos;s development goals .
the main contributors &apos; financial assistance to Sri Lanka are Germany , the Netherlands , Sweden , the European Union , the United States of America , France , Spain , Austria , Denmark , Belgium , Russia , Australia , the United Kingdom , and Hungary .
with the gradual conversion of Sri Lanka to a middle-income economy in 2010 , the composition and form of foreign financing from Western countries and credit agencies have changed significantly .
the lack of concessional financing coupled with low-interest rates has resulted in the development assistance from these countries and institutions shifting from a combination of non-concessionary and concessionary credit facilities to export credits .
these funds are mainly received in the form of I ) Export Credit II ) Commercial Credit III ) Traditional Loan IV ) Grant .
foreign financing under export credit is primarily invested in commercially viable projects that can generate sufficient economic returns or income to cover debt repayment .
accordingly , most of the commercial credit from the West has been used to complete the infrastructure projects such as roads , bridges and water supply , accelerated and pre-emptive development projects and hospital development and health care facilities with the objective of providing quality , high-tech and reliable health care to the people .

Monaragala - Buttala Water Supply Project
compared to the National Drinking Water Supply Scheme which is 43.5 % , the Monaragala district &apos;s pipe-borne water coverage covers only 20 % .
the existing drinking water supply schemes in the district cannot provide an uninterrupted supply of water to Monaragala and Buttala towns and it is not sufficient to cover drinking water needs in urban areas such as Madulla-Okkampitiya .
under the proposed Monaragala-Buttala Water Supply Scheme , a water treatment plant of 6,000 cubic meters per day will be constructed and a 110 km water supply network covering 43 Grama Niladhari Divisions will be constructed .
the project will provide drinking water to 50,000 families and commercial and industrial sectors in the area .

accordingly , the Government of Sri Lanka entered into a loan agreement with Deutsche Bank of London and Rabo Bank of the Netherlands to build 1,000 rural bridges .
it aims to provide transport facilities to a large number of underprivileged villages and increase access to the rural people for market , education and health facilities .
importation of dairy cows
the local liquid milk industry has the potential to produce substantial quantities of quality liquid milk to the current market while maintaining reasonable profit margins and minimizing damage to the environment .
However , the current shortage of quality cows has hindered the growth of this dairy industry .
also , the lack of high-quality breed animals has led to decline the quality in this industry .
Performance Report 2014
Department of External Resources
therefore , the importation of 2,500 dairy cows by the proposed project will ensure the development of substantial quantities of milk and allied products .
the project will also help develop the Ridiyagama farms to meet the animal breeding needs in the Southern Province .
with the implementation of this project , it is expected to increase the country &apos;s liquid milk production .
one of the objectives is to save foreign exchange for milk products .
the proposed project is expected to create a large number of jobs and will undoubtedly contribute to the reduction of rural poverty and malnutrition .

to be the Virtual , Entrepreneurial , Technological University with International Standards
our Mission
Producing Entrepreneurship Oriented Graduates and other Human Resources in technologies associated with Regional Sciences through an entrepreneurial Institution supporting knowledge Economy of Sri Lanka .
acting Director ’ s Review
Institute for Agro-technology and Rural Sciences which was inaugurated in 1990 has come a long way since its inception and has established itself as an Institute providing much needed contemporary technology and scientific knowledge to rural agricultural community in Sri Lanka .
commencing its activities by providing tissue cultured banana plants , which is economically viable and environmental friendly , the Institute has started imparting modern technological as well as theoretical aspects of Agriculture and Regional Sciences by introducing 03 study programmes .
this provides strategic and practical knowledge through various stages from Certificate , Diploma , Higher Diploma and Agriculture Degree levels .
these study programmes have become very popular among rural farmers , who are interested and enthusiastic in gaining new knowledge .
on successful completion , these farmer students are awarded with a certificate according to the level of achievement .
in addition to that , the students are also provided special rewards .
those students who successfully complete the Higher Diploma will be able to read for their Bachelors Degree thereafter .
the management of the Institute ably assisted by the present Chairperson of the UGC , Prof. Kshanika Hirimburegama and the Vice Chancellor , University of Colombo , Dr. Hirimburegama has now embarked on further strengthening the Institute by introducing three degree programmes encompassing the study areas of Environment Sciences , Agricultural Technology and Regional Sciences .
the Institute has been able to expand the activities connected to Tissue Cultured Banana Plants production by increasing the existing laboratory facilities .
two new “ Net Houses ” have been constructed and negotiations are going on with identified funding agencies to further improve the “ Net Houses ” using latest technology .
the Institute has been able to make itself a self sustainable unit largely due to the income generated through the sales of Tissue Cultured Banana Plants .
it is observed here that , the price quoted by the Institute for a Banana Plant is half the price compared to the open market but continue to keep it that way as a service to local farmers .
one of the unique aspects intumesced is the Institute is its dedicated staff .
all of whom are employed on assignment basis and provide a high quality service which is another unique aspect .
their performance are appraised at the end of each year and compensated adequately according to the evaluation .
the potential and the capability of the Institute will be thoroughly tested in the coming years as the external environment related to many aspects , both commercial and academic may become very competitive .
on the other hand , the newly established Hambantota Harbor and Mattala Airport have opened many areas for new entrepreneurial projects where the University of Colombo Institute for Agro-Technology and Rural Sciences can become the guiding light in making those ventures extremely viable .
our ultimate aim is to develop the University of Colombo Institute for Agro-Technology and Rural Sciences as a modern Regional University providing globally compatible human resources and technological inputs assisting the Sri Lankan economy at large .

Performance in year 2012
in the beginning it was difficult to introduce a new technology like Tissue culture to the farmers due to their addiction towards the conventional agriculture .
after several years , with much effort and addressing practical issues associated , the farmers accepted the Tissue Cultured banana plants due to its high quality and quantity of production .
Figure - 04
comparison of Laboratory Issues and Plant Sales in last Five Years
three Tissue Culture laboratories are located inside the Institute .
every month these laboratories produce around 15,000 Tissue Cultured banana plants in three varieties .
( Embul , Kolikuttu and Ash plantain )
demand for the Tissue Cultured banana highly depend on the climatic conditions but highest demand is recorded in the rainy season
( September to April )
as well as the low demand in the dry season
( May to August )
Figure – 05
Figure – 06
Figure - 05 and 06 illustrates total banana plants planted in the nursery and the total Sales during the year 2012 .
Tissue Cultured Embul banana is the leading banana variety produced by the Institute which represent about 97 % from the total banana production .
this is due to its ability to resist changing environmental conditions and higher yield .
Kolikuttu banana is the second leading variety which produces the highest income .
However , the production was temporarily reduced due to contaminated soil conditions in the farming fields specially Hambantota and Rathnapura districts with Fusarium oxyphorum cubensis fungal strain well known as &quot; Panama disease &quot; .
the institute changes its pattern of production as necessary , according to the fluctuations observed from the demand in rainy and dry seasons .
Tissue Cultured banana is the most demanded fruit in all around of the country .
the Institute directly facilitated more than 400 banana farmers representing all cultivation areas in Sri Lanka during year 2012 .
NGOs play a valuable role as indirect facilitators to extend the Tissue Cultured banana especially in Hambantota district with collaboration of the Institute .
the institute has facilitated rural entrepreneurs living in remote areas under “ Divi Neguma ” program by providing them no acclimatized Tissue Cultured banana plants .
this programme is supervised solely by the Institute .
the Institute conducted workshops in Dambana , Batticaloa and Ampara areas to make farmers aware of this technology and encourage them to cultivate banana in their areas .
our field staff regularly monitors their cultivations and provides necessary instructions and guidance they need .
these farmers were categorized according to their purchases .

Evolution of the Department
1.3 . progress and Regress during the year 2014
I . Introduction
with the beginning of the year 2014 , of the vacancies in the cadre existing over a period of time , a considerable number had been filled up .
under the program to recruit graduate to the government service , 200 new posts had been created within the department and it was possible to complete more than half of that number .
also , it was possible to fill up most of the vacancies in the posts belonging to the Sri Lanka Administrative Service , by those who were recruited recently .
in the meantime , it was possible to fill in the post of Chief internal Auditor .
it must be mentioned that the increased volume of work handled by the Department had an impact towards this position .
However , it should be mentioned that progress in certain divisions were less due to reasons beyond the control at departmental level so the progress of some sectors was slowed down .
II . under the special program to implement the recommendations of the Lessons Learned and Reconciliation Commission which commenced in January 2013 , resolving disputes regarding State lands during the post conflict period in the Northern and Eastern provinces , more progress has been made in the year 2014 , than in the year 2013 .
feedback information regarding the National plan to implement the recommendations of this commission is being handled by a commission handed by the secretary to His Excellency the President .
at the discussions held on such feedback information , the progress of the programs implemented by the Department , has been acclaimed at a very high level , when compared with the progress of the implementation of the recommendations made by other ministries .
it should be mentioned that , whilst implementing this program , very special cooperation was forthcoming from the land commissioner ’ s in the said two provinces , as well as the Divisional Secretaries and form the assistant Land Commissioner ’ s appointed on contract basis for this program of work .
there were some problems caused by the pressure exterted on the officers , by the Provincial Councils and other local political authorities , when lands in the said provinces were acquired for the requirement of the State and the three armed forces
it was a special feature that no antagonism was shown after 2013 , towards the &apos; People &apos;s Land Problem Solving Program &apos; .
it was a special achievement to issue permits in respect of 27,172 lots of land , during this year in the Northern and Eastern provinces .
it was also a very special occasion , since it was the first time in history to ceremonially hand over 20,000 permits in one place .
III . completion of second stage of distributing of one hundred thousand lots of land
having completed the first stage of the National Program to distribute one hundred thousand lots of land which commenced in 2005 , the second stage of that program to distribute a further one hundred thousand lots of land began in August 2009 .
it was possible to handover 129 , 769 lots of land and permits to the people at the end the year 2014 .
iv . Activating State Land Information and Management system
to find a successful remedy to the longstanding inefficient administration of State lands and delay in offering Services , it was possible to launch the State land Information and Management system .
as the first stage it was possible to successfully activate this year , the software prepared for furnishing information about lands distribution of lands and the procedures in the issuance up documents .
accordingly , officers attached to 68 divisional secretary divisions were trained and implemented this system .
V. Creating of new Posts
whilst doing away the longstanding shortcoming in the department it was possible to create a new post of Land Commissioner in the Administrative Division and a post of Chief Internal Auditor in the Accounts Division .
also , with the intention of expanding the legal division a separate division was created and a new post of &apos; Land Commissioner ( Legal ) &apos; has been created .
vi . evaluation of productivity improvement activities
in 2014 , The Land Commissioner General &apos;s Department participated in the developmental National Productivity Award Competition for year 2013 .
for this purpose a unit for productivity operation was established and an Assistant Land Commissioner was appointed to co ordinate activities .
among the program implemented targeting this competition , it was especially possible to implement the 5S concept at a high level .
this Department was able to win the special merit award at this competition .
vii . delay in serving in the Tamil language
this department is engaged in the services of solving a large volume of land problems in the Northern and Eastern provinces especially after the war .
a large number of applications , letters , appeals etc submitted to the Department are in the Tamil language .
However , the less there is only a handful of officers in the Department , who are knowledgeable to work in the Tamil Language .
there is only one staff officer to work in matters regarding subject of land .
there is only one management assistant .
though there is a vacancy for Tamil Language translator , the vacancy could not be filled for a long time .
under these circumstances , a large volume of day to day documents are being translated utilizing outside translators
the unnecessary delay is unable to control .
2 chapter - Strengthening Land possession of landless people
2.1 Introduction
according to the circular number 2008 / 04 a program to identify landless people and registering them at the Divisional Secretaries level .
a majority of these people these registered , are those who are residing on State lands over long period of time and have not received ownership of such lands .
a special program to distribute land to landless people was started with the distribution of hundred thousand lots including encroached lands and new lands that are suitable to be distributed .
that goal was completed in 2009 .
under the second stage of this program of work , land lots exceeding one hundred thousand in number were further distributed to landless people by the year 2014 .
this is being continued as a program of work , to make available lands to landless people .
2.2 Distribution of lands
distributing of lands under the Land Development Ordinance to Sri Lankan , giving priority to people in the lower-income groups and those belonging to the farmer ’ s class .
permits are issued for residential and agricultural purposes under the State Land Ordinance and also lands are provided to those in the higher income groups for agricultural , residential industrial and commercial purposes and those living in urban areas and institutions .
2.2.1 Issuance of lease bonds under the land Development Ordinance
it was possible to issue one hundred thousand permits from January 2006 up to the year 2009 and 129,769 land permits from there onwards up to the end of the year 2014 .
it was targeted to issue 25,000 land permits to landless people during the year 2014 , and it was possible to issue 42,781 permits .
though this position showed a decrease of 14.2 % in relation to the previous year , it was an increase of twice the number issued in 2012 .
Lesser co-operation received from some Divisional Secretary divisions and Provincial Councils in the process of selecting permit holders through the holding of land kachcheries and shortage of staff were the factors for this set back during the current year compared to the previous year .
2.2.2 Issuance of long term lease bonds under State Land Ordinance Lands are provided by The Land Commissioner General &apos;s Department for agricultural , residential , industrial , commercial purposes , etc. to State and private sector institutions and individuals as well as to prospective investors who are expecting to be engaged in investments in special development projects .
19,743 long term lease bonds have been issued from 1995 up to now .
encroachers who were in unlawful occupation of state lands prior to 1995.06.15 were allowed to be selected for the issuance long term lease permits or Grants under State Lands Ordinance .
this process was implemented in 2008 and since a reasonable period of time was allowed for this .
it was decided to stop after the year 2010 , further issuance of lands on the basics of encroachment .
accordingly , instructions were issued that lands that are processed by encroachers also should be selected through the system of land Kachcheries .
since it took a longer period to issue lease approval due to the shortcomings prevailing in the process , the target for the issuance of long-term lease bonds and grants was reduced in the year 2014 also .
Issuance of long-term lease bond is a very long process .
the Divisional Secretaries send all documents with their reports of recommendation through the Land Commissioners / Deputy Land Commissioners ( Interprovincial ) .
these documents after having been checked should be submitted to the minister for the approval to lease through the secretary of Ministry of Lands .
Notifications are published in the Government gazette for objection and after the stipulated period , possession of lease recovery is handed over .
after this , the lease bond is prepared after obtaining the diagram and submitted to the Presidential Secretariat through the Ministry of Land and after facsimile signature on the lease bond , it is sent for registration through the Divisional Secretary and after having been registered , the lease bond is issued .
under the subject of issuing long term permits for the year 2014 , 3783 recommendations were sent to the ministry through the target was 3500 .
when the target under the regulated system of handing over possession of the land was 1000 , long term permits for regulated possession handed over was 1054 .
the target under the program to issue long term lease bonds was 500 and it was possible to issue 654 such permits .
this is an improvement over the previous year .
However , an upward difference was observed in the year 2014 , between the number of applications sent to the Minister for long term lease approval and in the number of applications approved .
due to this reason , there is a decrease in the progress in handing over the possession and issuing lease bonds .
2.2.3 Distribution of lands under the Bim Saviya program
&apos;The Bim Saviya Program &apos; could be introduced as a National Program , providing ownership to those lands contributed mainly by the Ministry of Land and Land Development and the Title Settlement Department .
this program commenced its activities in 2008 as a National program with the contribution of the Ministry of Land and Land Development , and some institutions under this ministry and also with the participation of the Register General ’ s Department .
the program by the Land Commissioner General ’ s Department to provide solutions to problems regarding state lands were also implemented in the year 2014 .
that program was implemented with the assistance of the Provincial Commissioners , Divisional Secretaries , and Inter-Provincial Deputy Land Commissioners .
accordingly , under the program , 106,847 permits for state lands had been issued for state lands ( up to now ) .
32,441 grants and 19,550 long-term licenses have also been distributed among the public .
the target issue permits under the Bimsaviya program was 30,000 for the year 2014 , and it was possible to issue 39,734 permits .
this registered an increase of 27.8 % in relation to the previous year .
Likewise , 4983 grants and 2897 long term permits also have been issued .
the overall progress in the previous year was 51,042 whilst overall progress was 48,797 this year .
shown here are only the permits , grants , long term lease permits under the Land Development Ordinance .
in addition , Pooja Bhoomi grants , Tsunami grants , Free Grants , vesting orders Instruments of disposition are included in the overall progress .
since their numbers are small , they have been included the main category only .
2.3 Issuance of Grants
though some administrative powers regarding the management of state lands have been given to the Provincial Councils through the 13th amendment to the constitution , the special role of implementing the legal powers of the President , regarding the disposal of ownership of State Lands were vested with the Land Commissioner General ’ s Department .
when alienating the ownership of state lands , issuance of Ranabima grants under the Land Development Ordinance , issuing of grants under the state lands ordinance , issuing of Free grants , issuing of Special grants , issuing of Pooja Bhoomi grants , issuing of Tsunami grants , issuing of vesting orders under the Land Grants ( Special Provisions ) Act is a major concern .
2.3.1 Issuance of grants under the Land Development Ordinance
after the Lands for which permission has been issued under the Land Development Ordinance been developed , issuance of Ranabima grants giving permanent ownership , subject to conditions , is the main function performed by the Development Branch of the Department .
for this purpose , the Ranbima unit in this Division is giving active contribution .
an organized program commenced in 1982 to issue grants for State lands distributed under the Land Development Ordinance and 997,158 grants consisting of 324,203 Swarna Bhoomi grants and 672,955 Jayabhoomi grants had been used to the allocated by the beginning of 2002 .
these grants were prepared with conditions , and diagrams are included only in the Swarna Bhoomi grants and a large number of Jayabhoomi grants are prepared without survey diagrams were included only the four boundaries of the land .
considering this shortcoming , with the objective of issuing grants inclusive of a diagram and without conditions , action when taken to revise the Land Development Ordinance commencing in 2002 and the revised bill was submitted to the Parliament in 2003 .
due to this reason issuance of grants was temporarily stopped withdrawn to be revised during the years 2002 and 2003 .
However , the revised bill had to be withdrawn for re-amendment on the judgment of the Supreme Court .
after this , the issuance of grants as usual , commenced again in 2004 .
it has been possible to issue 72,635 grants from 2004 up to the end of the year 2014 .
it was planned to issue 10,000 Ranbima grants during the year 2014 and it was possible to issue 10,011 grants by the end of the year .
this is a 34 % increase over the previous year .
2.3.2 Issuance of middle-class grants under the Land Development Ordinance
the land development ordinance was envisaged to give lands not only to the landless peasantry .
citizens with some financial or capital capability are also able to acquire a piece of state land , who would develop the said land and contribute actively to enhance national productivity .
accordingly , state land with the extent of 10 , 25 and 50 acres are alienated to each person in the middle class .
lands had been distributed in the past to middle-class schemes in areas where land was available in plenty .
grants have been issued to some people after the land was developed .
However , no grants have been issued yet for some lands .
due to the prevailing shortage of lands at present , as a matter of policy , such large plots of lands are not made available under the middle-class scheme .
However , issuing grants to lands issued with permits are being continued .
in issuing grants , if such grants have been disposed of contravening the terms and conditions in the Land Development Ordinance when if such grants have been registered in the records at the Land Registry and if not satisfied about the accuracy of such document , the Land Commissioner General has the power to render it null and void .
in the year 2014 , it was targeted to issue 45 middle-class grants and it was possible to issue 24 such grants .
the full value of the land should be paid when obtaining grants for lands with a middle-class license .
However , there is no barrier to using the land with a license .
However , if want to transfer the land , you should have a grant .
due to this reason , the demand for grants for licensed middle-class land does not increase .
2.3.3 Issuance of free grants
here , for lands distributed with long term lease bonds or preliminary lease tree lands , free grants with permanent ownership are issued for the people to occupy and possess some land .
However , such grants are not issued for commercial purposes .
it was planned to issue 250 free grants during the year 2014 and it was possible to issue 247 grants as at the end of the year .
2.3.4 Issuance of Pooja Bhoomi grants
Issuance of grants to the place of Buddhist Religious worship is being done every year .
the issuance of such grants during the current year is shown below .
1618 Pooja Bhoomi grants have been issued up to now .
it was planned to issue 50 Pooja Bhoomi grants during the year 2014 and 88 grants were issued at the end of the year .
this is an increase of 76 % over the previous year .
2.3.5 Issuance of Tsunami grants
issuing free grants ( granting alternative lands ) to the people displaced by the tsunami disaster is being done since the year 2007 .
accordingly , 5,060 grants have been issued up to now .
details
number of grants issued
though it was planned to issue 1000 Tsunami grants during the year 2014 , it was possible to issue 689 grants at the end of the year .
2.3.6 Distribution of lands under the Land Grants ( Special Provisions ) Act ( Issuance of instruments of disposition )
the Act has been implemented since 1979 .
according to this Act , the land distributed is from those lands which were vested with the land Reform Commission .
the government releases these lands for distribution to landless families .
these lands are issued to the poor people , who do not own any piece of land .
the total number of lands these distributed since 1979 is 77,903 .
according to the policy decision taken by the Land Reforms Commission , lands are not released under this Act from recent times .
when unproductive lands belonging to the Land Reforms Commission are identified to distribute to landless people , provisions have been made for the purpose of village expansion only by paying compensation under the Land Acquisition Act .
due to this reason , no new lands are distributed under the Lands Grants ( Special Provisions ) Act .
action is being taken only regarding lands where actions pre-commenced but not completed on yet .
250 instruments of disposition were planned to be issued during the year 2014 under the Land Grant ( Special Provision ) Act and it was possible to issue 285 instruments of disposition .
2.3.7 Venting of Lands , mortgaging and subleasing lands Issued on Long Term Leases under State land Ordinance Land Commissioner General &apos;s approval should be obtained for Venting of Lands , mortgaging and subleasing .
the manner how approval is granted for venting of lands , mortgaging and subleasing took place during the year 2014 , is shown below .

5 . Chapter - Management of Revenue
5.1 Introduction
a very special role is performed by the Land Commissioner General ’ s Department , to strengthen the rental revenue of the State through the best management of State Land resources .
the State lands are leased for residential and Commercial purposes to individuals , State , and private institutions and rental income is collected from them .
Land rental revenue is collected from the areas coming under the interprovincial regions that are collected by the Land Commissioner General ’ s Department and the rental income from the rest of the areas is collected separately by the provincial Land Commissioner Department .
this income structure mainly consists of long lease rental , annual permit rental , and harvest rental .
the income from areas under the Provincial Councils are a source of income to the Provincial Council .
the Department plays a significant role in the formulation of the land leasing policy and contributing to the rent approvals for that source of income .
5.2 Estimating and Collecting of Land lease income
the amount of rental income that should be collected by the Land Commissioner General ’ s Department is forecasted half-yearly .
looking at this forecasting , the percentage of Land rental income that should be collected annually has gone up .
this position creates a tendency for State revenue to rise .
when forecasting the lease rental to be collected annually by the Land Commissioner General ’ s Department , calculating is done separately as new land rental income and arrears lease rental income .
when these two categories of lease rentals are taken as a whole , the percentage of Land rental to be collected and the percentage of lease rental collected has gone up .
this tendency could be understood when looking at the collection of Lease rental during the past few years .
an increase in new leasing of Land quantitatively and the asset value of Land going up have had the main impact for this tendency .
further , the reason could be seen in the decrease in concessionary leasing on nominal value and regulating the collection procedure .
lease Estimate and collected Lease rental income
lease Estimate ( Rs )
lease income for the year ( Rs )
here , though the lease income to be collected showed an increase , the lease income collected in the year 2014 when compared with the year 2013 shows a small percentage of about 5.5 % decline .
However , the amount of lease income collected from year to year has gone up .
in the same way , the amount of lease income collected has exceeded the lease income amount to be collected annually .
the reasons largely due to this situation are , the shortcomings in the fields in collecting Lease rental at the Interprovincial and Divisional Secretariat level , the shortage of well-trained officers for collecting lease rental income and the attitude the lessees .
inconsistency is seen on a large scale between the lease income amount and in the amount lease income collected annually due to the non-receive of cored forecasting about the lease payers and the lease revenue .
the e – slims program indicated by the Land Commissioner General ’ s Department is being operated more systematically to get rid of such a situation .
work has commenced to include information regarding new lease and the lease already existing in this new systematic process using modern technology .
this creates a more systematic way to collect and manage revenue .
Management of income will be made easier since the information is updated and shortcoming eliminated .
through this process , the structure of land lease income will be strengthened in the future .

since auctioning and elimination of movable and immovable assets were very much low , it is very clear from the data available that the Department has very efficiently managed its physical resources .
7.2 Composition of physical resources and changes occurred and procurement activities , eliminating goods
the remaining balance of fixed assets as at the end of the year 2014 was the same as in 2013 since there was neither new buildings constructed nor new buildings acquired for the department .
the number of movable assets has gone down from the previous balance and due to auction and eliminating in the year 2014 .
the eliminating position of timber goods has gone up in quantity in relation to other movable assets .
infrastructure facilities such as computers and accessories were purchased for the &apos; E - Slims &apos; and &apos; Bim Saviya &apos; projects and therefore there is a certain increase in the existing balance for the year 2014 .

Chairman Review
as in the previous years , AEA continued to work towards its goals of providing benefits to the Sri Lankan community using nuclear technology .
as Atomic Energy Act No. 19 of 1969 was very old and it does not consistent with the latest international requirements , in the relation to application of Nuclear Technology , approval of the Cabinet of Ministers has been granted to draft a new Act for Atomic Energy Authority on 22-06-2011 and the present the new draft Act contains provisions to meet latest international requirements on radiation protection , nuclear security , transport safety , safeguards , and radioactive waste management .
the draft was discussed with law enforcement officers of the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) .
the final draft was prepared with the amendments agreed with the officers and it was submitted to the Legal Draftsman on 4th November 2013 for approval .
corporate Plan for the period 2013-2017 was prepared &amp; submitted to the Auditor General &amp; Department of National Budget .
the activities of the AEA during the year 2013 are reported under the areas mentioned below .
( a ) Radiation Protection
( B ) Proceedings of the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA )
( c ) Maintenance and Repair of Nuclear Instrumentation
( D ) Measurement of Radiation Dosimetry
( e ) Non-Destructive Testing
( f ) Radiation Processing
( g ) Nuclear Analytical Services
( H ) Isotope Hydrology
( I ) Information Services
( j ) Manpower Development
the AEA continued to provide radiation protection services to the state and private sector organizations to achieve safety norms by performing regular inspections of premises that use radiation sources and radioisotopes .
the users who possess radioisotopes or irradiation apparatus including medical X-rays have to obtain a license from AEA and in 2013 , 186 such licenses were issued .
further , import and export of radioactive materials have to be carried out with the approval of the AEA and 522 such authorizations were issued in the year 2013 .
inspection of premises that use radiation and radioactive material is also a responsibility of the AEA and the number of such inspections carried out was 138 .
56 approvals were provided for Irradiation room plans after they complied with the recommendations given by the AEA .
Seventy radiation monitoring instruments that belong to AEA and external institutions were calibrated and certificates were issued .
1100 radiation workers were regularly monitored monthly / bimonthly .
in the industrial sector , AEA was able to provide 143 NDT inspection services to industries for its effective functioning of the machinery used , enabling greater productivity .
in addition , 211 personnel were trained in NDT technology .
AEA is continuing its effort towards establishing a dedicated centre for NDT services including manpower development in order to strengthen its services required of the industrial sector of the country
Life Science Division ( LSD ) provides its services to the import and export sector , industrial sector , Research &amp; Development institutions .
as a result of R &amp; D activities carried out by the Radiation Processing Section , the AEA was able to develop several environmentally friendly products using natural polymers &amp; radiation modification techniques .
Plant growth promoter with fungicidal properties developed using natural polymer delivered to Dragon Fruit Growers Association so as to carry out field trials on infected Dragon Fruit Fields .
the project titled “ Establishment of Multi-Purpose Gamma Irradiation Facility ( MGIF ) ” at Biyagama is implemented by the Ministry of Technology &amp; Research .
the AEA provided technical support for the project .
the AEA has recruited and trained necessary manpower and procured necessary equipment for the smooth operation of the facility by early January 2014 .
AEA is functioning as the focal point to the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) for obtaining technical assistance under its Technical Cooperation Programme .
with the assistance of the IAEA and the Japanese and Korean Governments , the AEA continued to develop the technical capabilities of the scientists .
in that regard expert services ( 19 numbers ) , fellowships and scientific visits ( 21 numbers ) , short term foreign training , and seminars for local scientists ( 140 numbers conducted in foreign countries ) .
in-house human resource development was also promoted through courses conducted for administrative and support staff of AEA .

total income had been dropped by 7 % in 2013 when compared to the previous year mainly due to the following reasons .
1 . income generated from NDT inspections services increased remarkably due to special demand received from Shell Gas PLC and Alston Co. during the year 2012 .
2 . Similarly , large numbers of spent radiation sources were collected in 2012 on the requests received by several customers .
there were no such requests received during the year 2013 .
therefore , the generated income from Radiation Protection Services was not up to the expected level .
AEA expects to focus its attention on new income-generating sources such as concrete testing , welder qualifications , boiler inspections , and new training courses to overcome the above situation .
I wish to thank the Members of the Board of Management , Senior Management , and the staff of AEA for their active co-operation in carrying out the above programs successfully , even being in the competitive market situation .

7 . 2 Research and Development activities using Gamma spectrometry
a ) Monitoring of Environmental Radioactivity levels was continued in collaboration with other Divisions of the AEA .
the purpose of this activity is to establish the national baseline levels for radioactivity present in the environment and to prepare a radioactivity map for Sri Lanka .
Altogether , 98 samples of soil and vegetation collected from different locations in the country have been analyzed for the existing radionuclides in the samples .
B ) Marine Environmental Monitoring Programme
it aims to quantify marine environmental pollution caused by the Fukushima nuclear power plant accident .
Sri Lanka has been able to establish its marine radioactivity data base successfully with the technical support provided by IAEA through the implementation of the regional project RAS / 7 / 021 “ Marine benchmark study on the possible impact of the Fukushima radioactive releases in the Asia-Pacific Region ” .
under the leadership of the National Project Coordinator ( NPC ) assigned by the Atomic Energy Authority ( AEA ) of Sri Lanka , a dedicated National Project Team ( NPT ) was formed in Nov 2011 to achieve the objectives of the above project .
an expert mission was arranged by the IAEA to train the NPT in sampling methodologies in Feb 2012 and six NPT members were able to receive necessary training through the regional training courses ( RTC ) organized by IAEA .
with the inputs of IAEA and the local counterpart institutes , the AEA has been able to conduct a successful study in the marine environment to check whether there was any direct impact on the marine waters , sea food and sediments due to the radioactive releases from the Fukushima nuclear power plant accident took place in Japan in March 2011 .
AEA was able convinced the general public that there had not been any direct impact on its marine environment due to these investigations .
However , in parallel , the AEA launched a monitoring of imported fresh fish and canned fish to Sri Lanka in order to assure the quality of such food .
Although there were number of canned fish contaminated with cesium 137 and 134 , the level of contamination was found to be below the permissible levels stipulated by Sri Lankan government .
the fresh fish samples collected from the local catch have also been analyzed for possible contamination with 137 Cs and 134 Cs during the last two-year period and it was revealed that none of the samples was contaminated .
over forty surface sediment samples and fourteen sea water samples ( each &gt; 1000 L ) and several biota samples were collected from the sea at locations near Delft , Nainativ , Poonerin , Mannar , Kalpitiya , Negombo , Mt . Lavinia , Beruwala , Mirissa , Kirinda Arugambe , Pasekuddah , and Trincomalee during Feb- 2012-Oct 2013 .
the existing levels of natural and artificial radioactivity concentrations of 40 K , 226 Ra , 232 Th , 210 Pb , 137 Cs and 134 Cs in marine coastal sediment and 137 Cs and 134Cs in seawater collected from those selected locations were measured by high-resolution gamma spectrometry technique at the Nuclear Analytical Laboratory of the Atomic Energy Authority .
c ) Soil erosion measurement project ; RAS / 5055 - ‘ Improving Soil Fertility , Land Productivity and Land Degradation Mitigation ’
this project is being implemented in collaboration with Natural Recourses Management Centre , Department of Agriculture to assess the erosion status of selected landscapes in Central Highland of Sri Lanka .

Although , a regular testing programme is conducted for monitoring such food items imported to the country , the random sampling is continued in order to assure the public safety .
e ) In addition to the above contribution , a total of 30 samples have been analyzed for Bio dosimetry project of Faculty of Medicine , University of Kelaniya , Gem samples &amp; Meteorite samples received from the Department of Geology , University of Peradeniya , samples received from emergency preparedness programme &amp; Multipurpose Gamma Irradiation Facility ( MGIF ) for radiation protection purpose , and samples for Proficiency Testing ( PT ) &amp; Laboratory Inter-Comparison Testing ( QA / QC programme ) .
7 . 3 . R &amp; D Projects
a ) IAEA / RAS / 7 / 023 ; Supporting Sustainable Air Pollution Monitoring Using Nuclear Analytical Technology Air Pollution Monitoring Program was continued in collaboration with Central Environmental Authority and Department of Meteorology .
new sampling location was established at Meteorological station in Katugastota to monitor air pollution levels in Kandy area .
sampling is done twice a week and 71 ( pairs ) of Air Particulate Matter ( APM ) were collected in 2013 from Kandy and analyzed by using IBA / XRF techniques in USA for elemental concentrations .
data analysis and interpretation is being done based on statistical analysis and the finding will be disseminated to relevant authorities for further improvement of the air quality in Kandy area .
B ) IAEA / RAS / 5 / 062
Building Technological Capability for Food Traceability and Food Safety Control Systems through the use of Nuclear Analytical Techniques
the capability to certify food origin or authenticity is of significant economic importance to many stakeholders in developing countries .
for example , some food products can be marketed using labels ( e. g . GI , Geographic Indication ) that are based on standards of identity or composition related to a very specific production area .
producing safe and high quality food is a prerequisite to ensure consumer health and successful domestic and international trade , and is critical to the sustainable development of national agricultural resources .
traceability systems play a key role in assuring food safety .
the intention of this project is to build the technical capacity in the member states ( MS ) so that MS will be able to implement traceability systems based on nuclear techniques .
this will be achieved by developing systems for one or two products ( Rice &amp; Honey in the beginning ) , these systems can then be used as templates for future application to other commodities such as Tea , Spices etc .
analytical techniques that enable the provenance of food to be determined provide an independent means of verifying “ paper ” traceability systems and also help to prove authenticity , to combat fraudulent practices , and to control adulteration , which are important issues for economic , religious or cultural reasons .
National Project Team ( NPT ) was formed this project .
one NPT member participated in the RTC held in Malaysia 28th January-08th February 2013 .
Rice , Paddy soils and water samples were collected from several locations where rice production is the main livelihood .
Rice and soil Samples were prepared for trace element analysis and Stable Isotope ( SI ) analysis .
Rice samples were analyzed for SI at the IAEA Seibursdorf laboratory in Vienna as there is no analytical facility in Sri Lanka for necessary stable isotope analysis .
the programme will be extended to Tea as it is among major export item and there are fraudulent practices .

accordingly , it was effective from 01-01-2013 in line with the decision of the Board of Directors on 07-12-2011 .
However , arrears payment of Rs . 1.4 million is payable to the Employee Provident Fund ( EPF ) for the period of May 2011 to December 2012 .

the bove vehicle had been obtained from the Sri Lanka Customs Department in 2009 out of detained vehicles .

the Board of Directors had recommended to obtain special approval from the Department of National Budget for this matter since the vehicle was registered under AEA in 2009 ( Below 10 years ) and obtained the required approval .
as the Director Automobile Engineering Training Institute ( AETI ) had made a request to hand over this vehicle for the use of training purposes , AEA granted the approval to the above request with the approval of the Department of National Budget through the Ministry of Technology &amp; Research .
the vehicle was handed over to AETI on 15.07.2013 and written off from the books and passed accounting entries accordingly .

Hon. Minister of Technology &amp; Research ( MOTR ) has submitted a cabinet paper No. 13 / 1728 / 526 / 023 dated 05.11.2013 on “ Establishment of a Private Company to Manage , Operate and Maintain Entities Established by the Atomic Energy Authority ( AEA ) and its Successor ” .
Although the above cabinet paper had been approved , the Board of Management of the AEA had observed the following contradictions between the cabinet memorandum and the approval .
1 . Hon. Minister had sought approval to forming of limited liability company owned by the AEA as per paragraph 5 of the memorandum and approval granted as ownership of the company is vested with the Secretary to the Treasury .
2 . However , the approval had also been granted to Hon. Minister ’ s proposal for AEA owned company , as the decision ( i ) states that paragraph 5 of the memorandum also approved .
3 . whilst decision ( ii ) ( a ) vests the ownership of the company on the Secretary to the Treasury , the decision ( iii ) , absolves him of direct or indirect liabilities of the company , which yet again as a contradiction .
considering the above facts , the Board of Management of AEA has decided to make a request from the Secretary MOTR to take steps to reconsider the said cabinet decision .
in addition to the above , Board has emphasized the important role played by the AEA in initiating the nationally important projects such as Multipurpose Gamma Irradiator Facility ( MGIF ) and National Centre for Nondestructive Testing ( NCNDT ) and the valuable contribution made by its officers together with the expert assistance from the IAEA to make the said projects a reality .
AEA is waiting for a revised decision in complying with the proposed structure as per the cabinet memorandum submitted by the Hon. Minister in this regard .
10 . expenditure incurred on construction of Multipurpose Gamma Irradiator Facility ( MGIF )
AEA has incurred initial expenses such as upgrading the facility by 100 Kci as instructed by the Secretary , MOTR , and other expenses for conducting trial runs , etc .
these expenses have been accounted for under non-trade debtors until the proposed company is formed .

the number of staff in 2013 compared to 2012 has been increased , EPF contribution increased from 3 % to 15 % , and the increase in the cost of living allowance has led to an increase in expenditure beyond 2013 income .
No additional Treasury allocations have been obtained for this increase .
the income from Non-Destructive Testing services and Radiation Protection services were decreased due to a decrease of demand for these services in 2013 .
the AEA has involved in several activities such as air pollution monitoring , Maintenance of Early Warning System , Water Resource Development Project , and Public awareness programme which do not generate an income .
the actual expenditure will be separately accounted in final accounts from 2015 .
3.2 Accepted Analytical Financial Review
capital Budget of 2012 and 2013 has increased markedly due to expenditure incurred for the construction of NCNDT .
4 . operating Review
4.1 Performance

this matter is under investigation with the Sri Lanka Customs Department to ensure whether these equipment are VAT exempted .
( B ) Training
Training Programmes are now conducted mainly in Non-Destructive Testing centers only .
a training center has been established of the NCNDT and the system has established for invoicing and collecting course fees .
( c ) Radiation Testing for Food Items
this issue was raised at the COPE meeting held on 26.11.2014 .
Secretary of the line Ministry wrote a letter to Director-General of Health Services of Ministry of Health who is the Chief Food Authority as directed by the COPE .
in response to the Director of Health Services , it has been informed that the relevant authorities have not released the customs clearance for food stocks pertaining to the above 43 samples .
further , according to PA / EOH / FCAU / 24 / 2013 dated 02.02.2015 of the Director of Health Services , the laboratory reports on the food samples tested by the Authority have not been handed over to the Customer , but will be delivered in advance to Deputy Director , Food Control ( Ministry of Health ) .
the Atomic Energy Regulatory Council of Sri Lanka ( IAEA ) has proposed to carry out further tests using code numbers to streamline the sample testing .
4 . 3 . Idle and Under-Utilized Assets
( a ) The laboratory equipment ( Rs . 9,417,746 ) was received under the Technical Programme of IAEA .

at present equipment is being utilized for the operation of the SLGC .
( B ) The equipment has been installed at the Sri Lanka Atomic Energy Board and in operation now .
4.4 Procurement of Machinery &amp; Equipment
( a ) 880 Della Projector with Ir-192
( I ) &amp; ( ii ) The equipment is mostly used in NDT exposure room which has been constructed as per Radiation Protection Regulations or all remote locations which again follow the same Regulations .
therefore , there is no danger in using the equipment in the exposure room .
Equipment was used for several Training Courses and workshops in the last 3 years .
steps have been taken to re-fill it when necessary .
( III ) Steps will be taken to introduce a movement register to record that movement information of the Equipment .
( B ) Eddy Current Tube Inspection Instrument
( I ) to ( iv ) This equipment was purchased with the objective of developing Eddy Current Tube Testing technology locally .
one officer had been sent to Malaysian Institute for Nuclear Technology ( MINT ) under a TC project , to obtain his experience not only on Eddy Current Testing , but also to study all other NDT technologies including advanced NDT techniques .
he had obtained general training on Eddy Current Testing .
we cannot expect that the same type of equipment used in Sri Lanka is available in MINT .

Atomic Energy AuthorityPerformance Report - Department of Co-operative Development - Sri Lanka 2014
Vision
Cooperative for sustainable development as a people &apos;s enterprise
mission
wider intervention to build good governance in cooperative societies by encouraging and developing cooperation business as a people &apos;s enterprise
Preface
it is with great pleasure that I hand you the Performance Report 2014 of the Department of Co-operative Development that has been functioning with the vision , “ cooperative for sustainable development as a public enterprise ” and the mission , &quot; wider intervention to build good governance &quot; .
this report presents , in three chapters , the concise descriptions on the structure and role of the Department , its internal administration , human relations development and auditing activities , legal affairs and co-operative societies and federations supervised by the Department .
specially , this report would assist those who are engaged in the studies of direct intervention of the Department as the major body that plays the vital role within the co-operative business to easily comprehend information .
since the provincial level co-operative organizations are governed by provincial departments with the decentralization of the co-operative subject , only the information of the co-operative societies coming under the control of the central government is included here .
I believe that the Department of Co-operative Development has been able to contribute to the upliftment of economic and social welfare of Sri Lanka through the cooperative movement .

Chairman ’ s Message 1.1.0
in 2013 , the Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Ltd . ( SLICL ) continued to demonstrate its stability , strength and long-term sustainability .
having established itself as one of the most respected players in the insurance industry , SLICL has an unparalleled assets base of over Rs . 143.56 billion , with a life fund of over Rs . 66.5 billion and over half a million policies in force .
it is the only Insurer in Sri Lanka to be ranked AAA by RAM Ratings Lanka Ltd , and AA ( lka ) by the global rating agency , Fitch Ratings ( London ) .
1.1.1 Performance
the Company recorded stellar performance in 2013 recording a profit before taxation of Rs . 6.35 billion for the year , the highest ever in the history of the insurance industry .
Life and General Insurance premiums recorded commendable growth rates as well , with all indicators moving in the right direction .
Gross Written Premium ( GWP ) grew to Rs . 8.4 billion for life insurance and Rs . 12.95 billion for general ( non-life ) insurance .
the combined GWP grew by 5.84 % .
SLICL is the market leader in motor insurance with a market share of 21.61 % as per the figures shared by the insurance players in the industry .
whilst the industry accounts for a motor ratio of 60.76 % , ours stands at a strong 56.34 % .
we have made substantial progress in strengthening our Life Insurance business as well .
our progressive business approach enabled us to benefit from the opportunities that arose in our rapidly growing nation .
our diversification strategy also made a key contribution in achieving an unprecedented consolidated profit during the year .
&quot; the Company recorded stellar performance in 2013 recording a profit before taxation of Rs . 6.35 billion for the year , the highest ever in the history of the insurance industry &quot;
1.1.2 Recognition
the SLICL Annual Report 2012 was successful in winning a Bronze Award in the Asia Pacific region under the Insurance Category at the 2012 Vision awards , organised by the League of American Communications Professionals ( LACP ) .
1.1.3 Outlook
the regulatory changes that are currently being implemented would have a positive effect on the insurance industry and encourage market consolidation .
these include the risk-based capital ( RBC ) regime , segregation of composites into life and non-life , an increase in minimum regulatory capital and public listing .
the split of life and non-life business from 2015 would promote greater transparency and policyholder protection .
the mandatory share market entry by 2016 will also enhance transparency and encourage good governance .
Premium growth is likely to continue , supported by low penetration in an economy that is still growing , though at a slower pace .
1.1.4 Appreciation
as I conclude , I convey my gratitude to the members of the Board of Directors , Managing Director and his staff , field sales personnel , strategic sales partners , insurance brokers and all other stakeholders for their unwavering support in making 2013 another year of momentous accomplishment .
H. K. Upali Dharmadasa
Chairman
21st March 2014
1.2.0 Managing Director ’ s Review
I am pleased to present the Annual Report of Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Ltd ( SLICL ) for the financial year 2013 .
SLICL is the largest composite insurance provider in Sri Lanka .
our performance during the year has reaffirmed our status as the most robust insurance company in the industry .
1.2.1 Excellent Performance
your Company recorded an impressive pre-tax profit of Rs . 6.35 billion for the year , which is a year-on-year increase .
this is undoubtedly the highest profit achieved in the history of our Company , and also the highest profit recorded in the insurance industry of Sri Lanka .
the life insurance premium grew by a commendable 13.95 % to Rs . 8.40 billion , whilst the general insurance premium increased to Rs . 12.95 billion during the same period .
the combined Gross Written Premium ( GWP ) grew by a healthy 5.84 % as well .
year after year , we have continued to declare unprecedented bonuses to our policyholders , reinforcing their trust in us .
this is consequent to the excellent management of our well-matured life insurance fund and prudent investments .
I am pleased to announce that we have declared a bonus of Rs . 4.5 billion for the year , which is the highest ever bonus recorded in the history of the insurance industry of Sri Lanka .
the cumulative life insurance bonus paid out during the past nine years has surpassed a massive Rs . 25.9 billion , making us the largest bonus paying insurance company in the nation .
1.2.2 Regulatory Changes
in order to strengthen customer confidence in the industry , several new regulations were introduced under the Regulation of Insurance Industry ( Amended ) Act No. 03 of 2011 .
accordingly , a Risk Based Capital ( RBC ) framework was introduced to protect the interest of the stakeholders and to minimize the risk of possible financial crisis .
the capital adequacy requirements and the solvency positions are regulated by this framework as well .
the Act also mandates composite insurance companies to segregate into two segments , as life insurance and general insurance .
1.2.3 Our Operations
Understanding the changing dynamics in the post-conflict economy , we played a vital role catering to the evolving needs with competitive prices , whilst preserving the credibility of our contractual obligations to the policyholders .
as the leading insurer of the nation , we give much emphasis to managing the risks of the Company , particularly the investment risk .
this is of paramount importance in the context of turbulent market conditions , characterized by highly volatile returns , reduced diversification benefits and wide dispersion in market sentiments .
the main focus of risk management at SLICL is to promptly identify , measure , manage , report and monitor risks that affect the investment objectives of the Company .
we also maintain a funding cushion of over Rs . 3 billion in liquid securities to meet obligations and a portfolio of readily marketable Treasury Bonds and Bills .
keeping pace with mobile technology , we tied up with a leading mobile service provider to offer greater convenience to our life insurance customers in making premium payments .
this facility has enabled us to define an advanced level of efficiency and convenience across the customer engagement value chain for insurance services .
the evolving regulatory environment has propelled insurance companies to replace their disparate legacy IT systems and embrace new technologies .
in this context , we implemented the Sap Treasury Module in 2011 , which has minimized operational risk of the Company to a great extent .
the Sap Financial Module is scheduled to be implemented in year 2014 .
as the leading insurer , we contribute towards a sustainable society through prevention and reduction of risk and through partnering economic development .
Abimansala , which has established several care homes for disabled war heroes of our country , is one such project , that we support .
details of many projects to which we have provided our support are presented in the Sustainability Review of the report .
1.2.4 Acknowledgement
as we conclude another excellent year , I extend my appreciation to the Board of Directors for their strategic direction and guidance .
I sincerely thank the staff members for their dedication and commitment , the field sales staff , agency force and brokers for their diligence and hard work at all times .
I am grateful to our loyal customers for placing their trust and confidence in us .
as we move forward , we will continue to focus on delivering unparalleled value to our customers and exceeding the expectations of all stakeholders as the trusted insurer to the nation .

1.3.0 Management Discussion and Analysis
1.3.1 Macro Economic Landscape
1.3.1.1 Global Economic Scenario
five years after the global financial crisis , the world economy showed signs of recovery in year 2013 .
with much impetus coming from advanced economies , the global economy recorded a growth of 3 % in 2013 .
a major impulse to global growth stemmed from the United States , which grew at 3 % in the second half of 2013 .
on account of moderate fiscal consolidation , accommodative monetary conditions , recovery of the real estate sector , higher household wealth and easier bank lending conditions , the project growth rate of USA in 2014 is 2.75 %
the growth in Euro was strengthened and turned positive in 2013 .
a strong reduction in the pace of fiscal tightening is expected to aid economic growth in the region in 2014
Emerging markets and developing economies continued to contribute to over two-thirds of global growth , and their growth is projected to increase from 4.7 % in 2013 to 4.9 % in 2014 .
China is expected to grow by 7 % in 2014 , based on rapid credit growth and implementing measures to put the economy onto a more balanced and sustainable growth path .
India expects to record a real GDP growth of 5.4 % in 2014 , based on revival of investments and export growth .
1.3.1.2 Economic Synopsis of Sri Lanka
GDP growth of Sri Lanka rebounded to a high growth trajectory of 7.3 % in 2013 , compared to 6.3 % in 2012 .
the conducive economic environment , stable macroeconomic conditions and favourable weather conditions had positively impacted the GDP growth .
the recovery reflects strengthened domestic demand and resurgence in exports and tourism .
economic growth was largely driven by the services sector , which accounts for approximately 60 % of the GDP .
the faster growth in sub sectors including wholesale and retail trade , hotels and restaurants , transport , banking , insurance , and real estate had enabled the service sector to record a growth of 6.4 % compared to the growth of 4.6 % in the previous year .
the industry recorded a growth of 9.9 % , which is slightly less than the 10.3 % that was recorded in 2012 , because of the slower growth in mining and quarrying and construction .
the agricultural sector was able to maintain the growth at a relatively satisfactory 4.7 % during the year , due to the favourable weather .
Trade account deficit was significantly narrowed due to increased growth in export earnings and decline in import expenditure .
Receipts on account of workers ’ remittances and earnings from tourism cushioned the trade deficit further during the year .
1.3.1.2.1 Economic Growth
as confirmed by the Department of Census and Statistics , Sri Lanka ’ s GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2013 amounted to 8.2 % , which is significantly higher than the growth of 6.3 % in the same quarter of 2012 .
this resulted in a GDP growth of 7.3 % for the financial year 2013 ; higher than 6.3 % in the previous year .
the agricultural sector , which accounts for 9 % of the total GDP , increased to 10.4 % in the 4th quarter of 2013 compared to 0.3 % in 2012 .
this is largely attributed to the 57 % increase in the paddy segment , amidst favourable weather conditions .
However , the overall growth of the agricultural sector for the year declined to 4.7 % in 2013 , from 5.2 % in 2012 .
the industry sector accounting for 33 % of the total GDP rose to 10.7 % in the 4th quarter of 2013 compared to 13.4 % in the same quarter of 2012 .
this was driven by a 13 % growth in the construction segment .
the overall growth of the industry sector for the year 2013 decreased to 9.9 % from 10.3 % in 2012 .
the services sector , which accounts for 58 % of the total GDP , grew by 6.5 % in the 4th quarter of 2013 as against 3.7 % in the 4th quarter of 2012 .
this was mainly on account of the import trade segment which grew by 2.0 % in the same quarter .
the overall growth of the industry sector was 6.4 % , which was higher than the 4.6 % in 2012 .
1.3.1.2.2 Investment and Savings
the total investment income of the insurance sector grew by 23 % to Rs . 29 billion in 2013 .
this is significantly higher than the growth of 3.65 % recorded in 2012 .
the increase is attributed to the growth of investment income in Government Securities and corporate debt securities .
the total investment income of the long-term insurance sector rose by 25 % compared to the marginal growth of 2 % in 2012 .
the total investment income in the general insurance sector increased by 18.4 % in 2013 , in comparison to 7.9 % in 2012 .
the pre-tax profit of the insurance sector increased by 11.4 % in the year under review , when compared to the decline of 2 % in the previous year .
1.3.1.2.3 Inflation Rate
inflation trended downwards in 2013 , averaging 6.9 % on an annual average basis for the year .
this was the fifth consecutive year in which inflation remained at a single digit .
the rate of inflation has a bearing on the insurance industry .
in an environment of rising inflation , the demand for life insurance diminishes due to the decline in purchasing power of individuals .
hence , the income earned from new business will reduce and the customer base too will erode .
1.3.1.2.4 Unemployment Rate
the unemployment rate is the number of people actively looking for a job as a percentage of the labour force .
this rate rose to 4.4 % in 2013 from its historic low in the previous year , mainly due to the entry of new job seekers to the labour market .
1.3.1.2.5 External Trade and the Balance of Payment
the trade deficit narrowed by 19.2 % to US Dollars 7,609 million in 2013 from US Dollars 9,417 million in 2012 .
this was consequent to the impressive growth in export earnings and the decline in import expenditure in the year under review .
Receipts on account of workers ’ remittances and earnings from tourism also cushioned the trade deficit substantially during the year .
the gradual recovery in advanced economies caused global trade to rebound strongly particularly during the 4th quarter of 2013 .
Sri Lanka ’ s exports responded positively to these favourable developments , by recording a growth of 6.4 % in 2013 .
industrial exports , which accounts for around three fourths of the total exports was the largest contributor of export earnings during the year .
import expenditure declined by 6.2 % mainly due to lower petroleum imports .
this was largely on account of the reduction in expenditure on intermediate goods , such as fuel , textiles and textile articles , fertilizer , diamonds and precious stones .
However , the import expenditure on consumer goods , which accounts for around 18 % of the total imports , increased by 6.3 % to US Dollars 3,182 million in 2013 .
the overall balance of the balance of payment recorded a surplus of US Dollars 985 million in 2013 , compared to the surplus of US Dollars 151 million recorded in 2012 .
this resulted in the increase of gross official reserves to US Dollars 7.5 billion equivalent to 5 months of imports , at the end of 2013 .
1.3.1.2.6 Economic Outlook - 2014
the World Bank cites that Sri Lanka would continue to grow at 7.3 % in 2014 as the economy was sustained by new capacity from infrastructure investments and rebuilding after the cessation of the war .
this forecast is far above the South Asian average of 5.2 % , as well as the growth estimates of other South Asian nations such as India at 5.7 % , Pakistan at 4 % , and Bangladesh at 5.4 % .
the projected GDP growth of Sri Lanka by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka is slightly higher at 7.8 % for 2014 .
However , a relatively protracted recovery in high-income countries and tightening of international financial conditions would limit a more robust rebound for Sri Lanka within the forecast horizon .
the risks to the outlook include weathering global commodity prices , maintaining fiscal consolidation , declining exports-to-GDP and managing the economic fundamentals in the context of currency fluctuations of major trading partners .
in addition , if the growth in two key export sectors , tea and apparels remains stagnant , there is a risk that the exports-to-GDP ratio will be a continued decline .
1.3.2 Insurance Industry
the insurance industry , which accounts for 3 % of the total asset base of the financial sector , recorded a growth in terms of premium income and the asset base during 2013 .
this was largely attributable to the improved business environment that prevailed during the year .
the soundness of the industry was further strengthened during the period .
there were 22 insurance companies in operation , of which 12 were composite insurers providing both general and life insurance business , 7 companies offering only general insurance and 3 companies solely engaged in life insurance business .
there were 54 insurance broking companies registered with the Insurance Board of Sri Lanka ( IBSL ) as well .
the total Gross Written Premium ( GWP ) amounted to Rs . 87.15 billion while total assets stood at Rs . 301.92 billion as at the end of the year 2012 .
the insurance penetration as a percentage of the GDP was 1.15 and insurance density was Rs . 4,287.28 in year 2012 .

1.3.5.4 Asset - Liability Matching
Life Fund : matching the maturity structure of the life fund is a challenging task in the context of a relatively less developed fixed income securities market .
However , the significant amount of listed debentures offered during the year enabled to mitigate this risk to a considerable extent .
as the investors moved to reap the benefit of granted income tax waivers , almost all these issues were heavily oversubscribed .
total funds raised via listed debentures by corporates during the year crossed Rs . 68 billion .
SLICL was able to invest Rs . 3.8 billion of this , in listed debentures with maturities ranging up to 10 years .
with many firms opting to raise funds through this route , there is a high probability of more listed debentures being issued in the coming year .
further , the investments in Government Securities exceeded Rs . 10 billion during the year with maturities extending up to 20 years .
a few 30-year Treasury Bond issues are scheduled for 2014 , where the company intends to invest in order to reduce the asset-liability mismatch in the life fund .
General Fund :
Unlike life fund assets , obligations of the general fund are short-term in nature ; hence , the major portion of the fund was invested in short- term assets .
1.3.5.5 Investment Performance
the Company achieved healthy returns during 2013 for both life and general funds under prudent and dynamic investment management mechanisms , whilst avoiding undue risks .
this is a commendable performance in an environment where the performance of the equity market was subdued .
SLICL recorded a total investment income of Rs . 9.2 billion during the year .
investment Income - Life Fund
SLFRS figures since 2010 . ( SLFRS )
the life fund recorded a healthy investment income of Rs . 7.2 billion in 2013 , which is a substantial 27.0 % increase compared to the previous year .
investment Income - General Fund
SLFRS figures since 2010 . ( SLFRS )
the general fund recorded an investment income of Rs . 2.0 billion in 2013 yielding a significant year-on-year growth of 41.7 % .

1.3.6 Current Status
currently , SLICL is evaluating the possible modes of segregating the composite insurance business into its two segments as required by the Regulation of Insurance Industry ( Amended ) Act No. 3 of 2011 .

2.0.0 Sustainability Report
the insurance industry has a vested interest in embracing sustainability
the industry has the capacity to influence individuals and businesses to be more sustainable through underwriting and investment practices .
at the same time , financial repercussions of unsustainable business practices also have a bearing on the insurance industry .
sustainability offers countless prospects for innovating insurance products and risk management services .
the launch of the principles for sustainable insurance at the UN Conference on Sustainable Development ( RIO + 20 ) is a further evolution of this important movement to build a green economy .
developed by the UN Environment Programme ’ s Finance Initiative , these principles form the framework for the global insurance industry to face environmental , social and governance risks and opportunities .

under the life decentralisation process , the authority limits of regional offices were increased up to Rs . 1 million and up to Rs . 700,000 / - for selected branches .
due to enhanced efficiency towards life policyholders , a total of 49,527 life policies were executed by the branches during the year .

2.1.6 Deyata Kirula Exhibition
SLICL was the main sponsor of the Deyata Kirula Exhibition held at the Hardy College Grounds , Ampara .
this was the largest national event of its kind in Sri Lanka .
a massive infrastructure development in the Eastern Regional Hub in Ampara occurred due to this exhibition .
a large-scale life insurance awareness campaign was carried out by SLICL in the East , concurrently with the national exhibition
the campaign was designed to highlight the importance of life insurance and the benefits it brings to individuals and loved ones in times of adversity .
the campaign was a resounding success with many individuals investing in life policies from the Company .
the SLICL stall at the Deyata Kirula Exhibition was structured as a replica of its head office building at Vauxhall Street , Colombo 2 .
this is a historical monument instrumental in providing protection to people of Sri Lanka for over 5 decades .
several talent competitions and quiz programs , which were conducted at the stall , attracted massive crowds during the exhibition .

4.0.0 Risk Management
introduction
Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Ltd . ( SLICL ) being the largest composite insurer in Sri Lanka has always given its paramount importance to the risk management function and this is endorsed by stable earnings , improved credit ratings and enhanced shareholder values achieved by the Company over the years .
for the year 2013 , Life Insurance business has maintained a solvency ratio of 11.48 whereas general insurance business has maintained a solvency ratio of 4.93 .
SLICL is the only insurer in the country who got the highest financial rating of AAA from RAM Ratings Lanka for its claim paying ability and also SLICL has got the highest financial rating among insurers from Fitch Ratings for its financial strength ;
net Asset Value of the Company stands at Rs . 53,175 million as at 31st December 2013 .
to comply with the future Risk Based Capital ( RBC ) framework , SLICL has been producing results for internal analysis from the second quarter of 2013 .
further , to fulfil requirements of RBC and to ensure optimum utilization of capital within the company structure , SLICL is formulating and centralizing its risk management function .
so far , as the test run is concerned , the results produced up to the end of 2013 are reflective of a position which exceeds the minimum threshold stipulated by the RBC framework .
the following mind map illustrates the main areas of risk management as per the RBC framework .
RBC Programme
Credit Risk
concentration Risk
reinsurance Risk
market Risk
liability Risk
operational Risk
Annual Report 2013 Page 76
during the year under review , there are different types of risks , not from an individual perspective
several initiatives were taken to view different types of risks holistically and diverting in to the right direction , the Risk Management Committee which previously consisted of only the members of the Board of Directors , was appointed with a broader membership representing a different spectrum of risk managers including finance , investments , actuarial , reinsurance , compliance , internal audit , human resource management and ICT .
all these departments have embedded ERM into their daily operations .
with a rising focus on risk management throughout highly regulatory sectors , many organisations have concluded that there should be an increasing focus on risk management at Board level .
this is consistent with the view that these organisations should have a separate Board level committee overseeing the risk management function , rather than merely relying on internal control systems comprising internal audit , legal or compliance departments .
Briefly , due to diverse reasons , the growth of the complexity of the risk management function , the increase of the number of external guidance sources specifically dealing with the risk management and the emergence of risk management as a discipline in its own rights can be mentioned .
highly regulated large entities such as SLICL have a great responsibility in considering a proper segregation of the roles between the Audit and Risk Committees .
accordingly , the Audit and Compliance Committee and the Risk Management Committee will independently oversee the risk management function of the Company .
as explained earlier , there is a regulatory drive and a business desire for risk management and the chart below outlines our approach to risk management .
Annual Report 2013 Page 77
Director
Board
Focusing on strategic risk issues , strategy setting , formulating high-level objectives and approving broad – based resource allocation
Disaster Management Committee
provide recommendations to the Board of Directors regarding a sound system of risk oversight , management and internal control and then formally announce , implement and maintain them
Owners and Managers
support the development , execution and maintenance of risk management systems .
the ensuing paragraphs deal with the risk management function of SLICL .
the ERM function is structured based on four broader categories of enterprise risk management covering areas pertaining to Insurance Risks , Investment Risks , Operation Risks and Regulatory Risks .
Annual Report 2013 Page 78
4.1.0 Insurance Risk Management
4.1.1 Life Insurance Risk
SLICL is a company , which has fulfilled responsibilities to its stakeholders for over 52 years and is an insurance company that has won the respect and the trust of the people .
a life insurance company faces risks in relation to its product design , underwriting and claims processes , investment , expenses and human resources .
in order to face these risks , the Company has created a methodology to identify the risk , quantify the impact of the risk , mitigate the risk and has adopted , tried and tested the best risk management practices to review periodically , the risks in the light of changing market and operational conditions .
the risk management practices are applied across the Board to product development , underwriting , claims settlement , holistically to underwriting and claims settlement , investment strategy and human resources .
product Development
SLICL provides a basket of products to cater to the needs of any policyholder at any given stage of their life .
the process of life insurance product development goes through a comprehensive risk management process at each stage of product development , where risks are identified , the impact of the risks are assessed , the measures to mitigate the risk and minimize the impact of the risk are put in place , and the risks are reviewed on a periodic basis .
extensive profit testing in the Model Office environment is the way in which the SLICL optimizes all its stakeholders ’ benefits .
the RBC framework is one of the elements in the Profit Testing and Model Office framework .
the life insurance products are developed by a Product Development Committee , comprising representatives of Sales , Marketing , Actuarial and Life Operations .
the product development task , which includes pricing , sales volume , expenses , is discussed in detail from a risk management perspective by a multi-disciplinary team , and the Managing Director of the Company gives the approval for the final product .
all products developed by the Committee are reviewed and approved by an Actuarial Consultant and a separate team reviews the progress of the selling and the distribution of these products to the customers on a quarterly basis .
Annual Report 2013 Page 79
underwriting
with regard to risk management in the underwriting process , a team headed by the Assistant General Manager – Life ( Technical ) , who is a Chartered Insurer identifies and analyses the impact of risks associated with the operational risks in the underwriting process which are reviewed periodically in consultation with the team of medical and non-medical underwriters to identify process improvements and risk mitigation measures on a quarterly basis .
the team visits the branches in order to ensure that the practices adopted by the head office are implemented and controlled accordingly to minimize the operational risks in the underwriting process across the entire head office and island-wide branch office network .
claims
with regard to the risk management in the life claims settlement process , a separate team headed by an Assistant General Manager – Life ( Technical ) , who is also a Chartered Insurer identifies and analyses the impact of risks associated with the operational risks in the claims process which are reviewed periodically in consultation with the team of claims managers , to ensure efficient settlement processes are followed in settling claims .
the claims are processed and settled centrally and in order to ensure the maintenance of departmental efficiency , regular reviews are conducted with the claim managers to discuss the operational risks and issues .
effective mechanisms are in place to track and avoid illegitimate claims .
risk Management in Both Underwriting and Claims Settlement
half yearly , the teams comprising the underwriting managers and claims managers have discussions with the Chief Officer – Life Insurance .
detailed operational issues including operational risks are discussed there and solutions and measures to mitigate prevailing risks are developed and adopted to eliminate or minimize such risks .
Insurance Liability Risk Management
under the SLFRS 4 , disclosures pertaining to risk management objectives / policies / methods , sensitivity to insurance risk , concentration of insurance risk and claims development information covering all periods for which material claims are outstanding ( 5 years approximately ) are required to be made .
Life Insurance Risk
the other facts included in the risks associated with life insurance
the death of the actual policyholder is the ‘ Mortality Risk ’ and in relation to life insurance policies , it is higher than the expected .
‘ Longevity Risk ’ is the risk that annual beneficiary will live longer than expected .
‘ Morbidity Risk ’ is the risk that policyholders ’ health related claims are higher than expected .
‘ policyholder behavior Risk ’ is the risk that policyholders ’ behavior in discontinuing and reducing contributions or withdrawing benefits prior to the maturity of the contract is higher than expected .
poor persistency rates may lead to fewer policies remaining on the books to defray future fixed expenses and reduce the future positive cash flows from the business written , potentially affecting its ability to recover deferred acquisition expenses .
‘ Expense Risk ’ is the risk that expenses incurred in acquiring and administering policies are higher than expected .
the Company has established procedures and processes to evaluate the above risks , which if not done can impact its operations .
the procedures are in place to cover all the critical stages from product development to benefit administration .
in addition to that , mitigating product designing and pricing risks , all life financial streams are modelled and profit testing is done by the Actuary .
also , SLCL uses matching instruments to back liabilities .
sensitivities Analysis for Life Insurance Risk
assumptions used in determining life insurance contract liability are tabulated below .
Assumption

valuation for 31st December 2013 is 3.5 % , which is consistent with the last five years .
the total liability set up under above guidelines is Rs . 55,465 million .
under the RBC road test , the results as at 31st December 2013 are as follows .
the total liability under RBC guidelines for base scenario is Rs . 15,233 million .

&apos;Concentration Risk&apos;
‘ Concentration Risk ’ is defined as the risk of exposure to increased losses associated with inadequately diversified portfolios of assets or obligations .
concentration risk for a life insurer may arise with respect to investments in a geographical area , economic sector , or individual issuers , or due to concentration of business written within a geographical area , of a policy type , or of underlying risks covered .
from a market risk perspective , although we have invested significantly in the financial sector , our portfolio is diversified and contains huge margins .
from an insurance risk perspective , the main factors that would affect concentration risk include mortality risk , morbidity risk , longevity risk , policyholder behavior risk ( lapse , anti-selection ) and expense risk .
as there is diversification across geographical regions , lines of business and even across different insurance risk factors , SLICL is not exposed to a significant concentration of insurance risk .
General Insurance Risk Management
Insurance liability risk management
under the SLFRS 4 , disclosures pertaining to risk management objectives / policies / methods , sensitivity to insurance risk , concentration of insurance risk and claims development information covering all periods for which material claims are outstanding ( 3 years approximately ) are required to be made .
General Insurance Risk
‘ General Insurance Risk ’ includes the reasonable possibility of significant loss due to uncertainty in the frequency of the occurrence of the insured events as well as in the severity of the resulting claims .
therefore , appropriate mechanisms are in place to manage the premium and claims liability risks , which are two aspects of the general insurance risks .
the following provides an overview of the Company ’ s main lines of business :
Motor includes automobile physical damage , loss of the insured vehicle and automobile third party liability insurance .
Property includes fire risks ( e.g. fire , explosion and business interruption ) , natural perils ( e.g. earthquake , windstorm and flood ) , engineering sector ( e.g. Boiler explosion , machinery breakdown and construction ) and marine ( cargo and hull ) .
liability includes general / public and product liability , excess and umbrella liability , professional liability including medical malpractice , and errors and omissions liability .
Special lines include Directors and officers , credit and surety , crime and fidelity , accident and health and crop .
workers ’ compensation and employers ’ liability include worker injuries .
the Company ’ s underwriting strategy is to take advantage of the diversification of general insurance risk across industries and geographic regions in which the Company operates .
the company seeks to optimize shareholder value by achieving its mid-term return on equity goals .
doing so necessitates a prudent , stable underwriting philosophy that aims to take advantage of its competitive strengths while avoiding risks with disruptive volatility .
at the core , underwriting is a robust governance process .
sensitivities Analysis for General Insurance Risk
the following table displays the sensitivity of net income before tax and the sensitivity of net assets , as a result of the adverse development in the reported claims outstanding by one decimal point .
such an increase could arise from either higher frequency of the occurrence of the insured events or from an increase in the severity of resulting claims or from a combination of frequency and severity .
the sensitivities do not indicate a probability of such an event and do not consider any non-linear effects of reinsurance .
based on the assumptions applied in the presentation of the sensitivity analysis in the table below , each additional decimal point that increases in the reported claims outstanding , would lead to a linear impact on net income before tax and net assets .
in addition , the Company monitors insurance risk by evaluating extreme scenarios , taking into account the non-linear effects of reinsurance contracts .

in addition to the specific risks insured , each line of business could expose Company to losses that could arise from natural and man-made catastrophes .
the main concentrations of risks arising from such potential catastrophes are regularly reported to the Senior Management .
the below table shows the Company ’ s concentration of risks within the General Insurance by-lines of business , based on direct written premiums before reinsurance and after reinsurance .

4.2.0 Investment Risk Management
investment risk management is of paramount importance in current turbulent markets characterized by high volatility of asset returns , reduced diversification benefits due to high correlations , and wider dispersion in market sentiments and views .
the aim of the investment risk management at SLICL is to promptly identify , measure , manage , report and monitor risks that affect the achievement of investment objectives .
this includes taking , avoiding , mitigating and adjusting the risk profile to maintain the appropriate balance between asset growth as well as income to meet the obligations of the Fund , based on prudent risk management principles within the context of applicable IBSL insurance regulations .
4.2.1 Interest Rate Risk
‘ Interest Rate Risk ’ is the risk of loss resulting from changes in interest rates , including changes in the shape of yield curve .
Credit Spread Risk describes the sensitivity of the values of assets and liabilities due to changes in the level or the volatility of credit spreads over the risk-free interest rate yield curve .
interest rate risk is managed over each major maturity bucket and adheres to the aggregated positions with risk limits .
key policy rates , i.e. Reverse Repo rate and Repo rate were changed three times during the year and remained at 8.00 % and 6.50 % respectively at the end of 2013 , displaying the intention of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka ( CBSL ) to keep the interest rates low .
Treasury Bill Rates saw a steep decline , falling from 11.69 % to 8.29 % during the year .
with the inflation under control , as the Government curtailed its local borrowings , the interest rates were expected to decrease further in the short to medium term .
the lack of long-term Fixed Income instruments yielding at acceptable levels of returns has brought in an Asset Liability Duration mismatch for the Life Fund .
However , the Fixed Income portfolio is being strategically managed by shifting from low yielding investments to higher return investments .
it is expected to mitigate the pressure on interest income through that .
in the previous years , SLICL has anticipated the fact that long-term interest rates could decline in the absence of long-term instruments and a proper regulatory regime ( later came with the RBC ) , the Life Fund was protected by slowly increasing the funds .

4.2.2 Market Risk
the lackluster performance of the equity market experienced in 2012 continued in 2013 as well , and managed to close down the year with a marginal 4.78 % gain ( 7.77 % including dividends ) .
However , as it appears that the market has bottomed out and become attractive in terms of valuations , a rebound is expected during 2014 .
this will be further supported by the developing low interest rate regime , which will divert the investors to extend their positions more towards equities .
all Share Price Index The Colombo Stock Exchange continued to attract foreign investors with a net foreign inflow of Rs.33 billion during the year .
Although , this seemed somewhat lower than the previous years ’ figure of Rs.39 billion , it still remains to be a significant achievement .
interest in fundamentally strong counters , particularly blue chips , has remained buoyant , as foreign investments have flowed steadily into these counters .

including The Lanka Hospitals Corporation PLC which is a subsidiary of SLICL
4.2.3 Credit Risk and Concentration Risk
‘ Credit Risk ’ is the risk associated with a loss or potential loss from counterparties fulfilling their financial obligations .
Credit risk is monitored and managed at each borrower ’ s level , as well as at the portfolio level in order to ensure a well- balanced portfolio , with a view to limit concentrations , in terms of risk quality , industry , maturity and large exposure .
SLICL has established limits to control the concentration in investments by single issuers and certain asset classes and investments in liquid instruments .
No investment has been made in Term Deposits other than in Licensed Commercial Banks and Licensed Specialised Banks .
investment grade credit rating for both the entity and the instrument by a recognized credit rating agency is expected for all investments in Corporate Debentures and Commercial papers .
No debt investment has been made in any of the related companies .
a comprehensive credit analysis is carried out internally , before making any investment .
4.2.4 Solvency Risk
‘ Solvency Risk ’ is the risk that the SLICL does not have sufficient liquidity to meet its obligations when they fall due , or would have to incur excessive costs to do so .
Life Insurance Fund
the fund needed a minimum liquidity whereas the premium income and the other financial flows exceeded the cash outflows .
this reflects the growing volume of business , the longer-term nature of liabilities and the reinvestment of maturing assets and other forms of principal payments .
However , in the upcoming years , maturities and cash outflows greater than the historical volumes , representative of a new phase in the fund ’ s policy maturity cycle , are expected .
Treasury Bond Investments can be used to match these expected maturities .
short-term allocation included a funding cushion of over Rs . one billion in liquid securities to meet policy obligations , tax obligations and investment opportunities .
these outflows are all managed from a Model Office system .
Modelling is done on a monthly projection basis and additional analyses are performed especially in months where liquidity issues arise .
together with multiple scenarios regarding new business , claims , policyholders ’ behavior and other parameters , this risk is well monitored .
short-term allocation included a funding cushion of over Rs . 3 billion in liquid securities to meet policy obligations , tax obligations and investment opportunities .
SLICL has maintained the required solvency margins during the financial year 2013 , pertaining to the life insurance business and the solvency ratio of 11.48 .
in addition , the life insurance business has maintained admissible assets amounting to Rs . 73,345 million ( Rs.65 , 176 million - 2012 ) while recording liabilities of Rs . 48,539 million ( Rs . 44,914 million – 2012 ) for the year 2013 .
General Insurance Fund . because of the uncertainty of cash out flows , liquidity remained to be an essential consideration for the General Fund .
it was important for the fund to maintain a portfolio of short-term securities , as an immediate liquidity reserve .
the fund also maintains a portfolio of readily marketable Treasury Bonds , together with a laddered maturity schedule and matching asset maturities against seasonal cash flow requirements . ( if appropriate )
4.3.0 Operational Risk Management
“ Operational Risk ” is the risk associated with the actions of the staff and the software systems .
with tight management and procedures , processes , systems and constant improvement of internal and external audit , the operational risk is managed to a minimum .
4.3.1 ICT Risk
information and Communication Technology related risk profile is built and it addresses all the identified ICT risks .
Special attention is given to the IT Security , Management Information and ICT Operational related risks .
Building a comprehensive Business Continuity Plan ( BCP ) and Information Technology Disaster Recovery Plan ( IT / DRP ) are the major activities identified during the year 2013 / 14 .
SLICL established a comprehensive online IT Disaster Recovery ( DR ) site to facilitate proper business continuity and recovery planning .
in addition , to the above tasks , major focus is given to mitigate continuous network and perimeter level related risks .
4.3.2 Reputational Risk
Reputational Risk is defined as the risk arising from negative perception on the part of customers , shareholders , investors or regulators that can unfavourably affect the Company ’ s capacity to uphold existing business relationships or to establish new business connections .
mainly the responsibility of the identification , escalation and resolution of reputational risk issues resides with the businesses .
the responsibility of controls groups such as compliance , legal and internal controls is to ascertain that such issues have been suitably identified , escalated , and resolved by the business .
the Cmpany has a sound system of internal controls to ensure that the reputation risk is mitigated .
the Company is committed to comply with all applicable laws , rules , regulations , and company policies .
4.3.3 Risk in Fraud and Misconduct
corporate Fraud and Misconduct remain a constant threat to public trust and confidence and the company is aware of the importance of anti-fraud measures to address the risk .
Presently the Company has effective fraud management systems in place across its operations that provide SLICL with tools to manage risks in a manner consistent with the regulatory requirements as well as the entity ’ s business needs and customer expectations .
Company ’ s Internal Audit function acts as one of the key functions in anti-fraud activities , supporting the management ’ s approach by preventing , detecting , and responding to fraud and misconduct .
further , the Compliance Department provides immense contribution towards implementing anti-fraud laws and regulations into internal control systems and conducts regular awareness training programs .
both Internal Audit and Compliance functions , report independent views about Company ’ s risk management of fraud and misconduct to the Audit and Compliance Committee along with their recommendations and preventive measures .
effective mechanisms are in place to track and avoid illegitimate claims in Life and General Insurance business .
the claim and underwriting processes are backed by an internal independent Investigation Department and the Company seeks external professional expertise services in appropriate instances .
SLICL has laid down procedures formally to respond and take corrective actions for detected frauds through well-qualified internal and external inquiry and prosecution officials monitored by the HR Department .
4.3.4 Human Resources ( HR ) Risk
though traditional risk specialists have paid little attention to human resources and human resources calamities , in the recent past , human resources management has gained its recognition on ERM .
HR plays a dual role in risk management .
first , people are a risk due to diverse reasons like shortage of skilled people and key employees leaving the organization etc . , and secondly , people are important in managing risks .
HR risk management is important from the perspective of strategic risk ( e.g. over reaching the human capital strategy ) , operational risk ( e.g. gaps in talent supply and demand ) , financial risk ( e.g. delayed services and compensation etc . ) and other risks including compliance ( e.g. unions , health and safety etc . ) and reputational risk , as depicted below
Topic
strategic Risk
operational Risk
Financial Risk
Compliance Risk and Reputational Risk
including other risks
the challenges encountered by the HR Department in managing HR risk and its impact on business outcomes , are discussed below .
a . retaining Talent
retaining the best talent is of paramount importance to be at the cutting edge in the industry .
when recruiting new staff , strategies such as aptitude tests , language tests , and assessment centers and scenario analysis would be used , in addition to the panel interview .
this would ensure the systematic evaluation of the candidate ’ s knowledge , skills and attitudes .
turnover will be reduced if the employees are able to continue their professional growth within the organization .
HR has identified the need of introducing an effective performance evaluation system and an employee recognition plan to motivate and retain key performers by providing training opportunities to enhance their knowledge and skills further .
B . maintaining Industrial Peace
identifying the importance of industrial peace , in order to maintain a cordial relationship with the employees , the management has entered into collective agreements with the two main trade unions .
c . staff Grievances
by appointing committees for staff promotions , transfers and grievances , the Company was able to successfully handle the staff burdens , which were a massive challenge to the HR Department .
every employee at SLICL was given an opportunity to apply for promotions annually , based on the criteria stipulated in the annual promotion policy .
deviating from the traditional promotional methodologies , we ensure that employee ’ s knowledge , skills and attitudes are systematically evaluated during the promotion process .
D . Department Structuring and Restructuring Projects and Departmental restructuring processes are carried out to identify areas of improvement ; further the work processes are being streamlined to be in par with the industrial changes .
4.3.5 Health and Safety Risk
with regard to “ health and safety risk ” , as a minimum , we abide by all the health and safety rules and regulations and are ready to go beyond those requirements when needed , in order to achieve the corporate objectives of the Company .
4.3.6 Operational Risks Pertaining to Investments
with the implementation of the SAP Treasury Module , the operational risk was all but eliminated .
with this pilot project being successful , the fully-fledged SAP Financial Module is planned to be implemented in 2014 .
4.4.0 Regulatory Risk Management
the latest view for highly regulated businesses such as insurance is that , the compliance programmes can no longer be adequate .
Moreover , the expectation is that the company transfers the appropriate talent and resources to compliance management solutions and to establish and maintain a ‘ strong ’ culture of compliance and ethics .
therefore , to address the changing business environment , the insurance industry has now paid attention for integrated Governance , Risk and Compliance ( GRC ) process and the plan .
at SLICL , the Compliance Department having valuable resources consisting of a Lawyer and two Chartered Accountants ensures compliance with applicable laws , rules , regulations and principles of good governance in line with the said premise of GRC .
Regulatory risk brings in certain costs and risks including the risk of compliance and the risk of introduction of new laws , rules and regulations or changes to the existing laws , rules or regulations .
the latest and prominent example of regulatory changes that had major implications for insurers is the amendment made to the Insurance Industry Act No.43 of 2000 .
a risk based capital framework has been introduced to the insurance industry to protect the interest of the stakeholders and minimise the risk of failure of the industry .
it is proposed that all the insurers should transfer to a Risk Based Capital Regime by 2006 .
the Company has been reporting under both Solvency Rules and RBC rules during the parallel run period from March 2014 onwards .
the Regulation of Insurance Industry ( Amended ) Act No.3 of 2011 has made it mandatory for the existing insurers in the insurance industry , to segregate their long term ( LTIB ) and general insurance ( GIB ) into two separate companies within 4 years from 2011 and accordingly to be listed within 5 years from 2011 .
the Company is working on the said segregation process to achieve its purpose efficiently .
a committee that consists of senior managers representing diverse subject areas has been appointed to address the matters pertaining to the said segregation .
SLICL is equipped with a comprehensive compliance framework .
‘ Compliance Programme ’ , designed for the use of the staff and management is available on the ‘ compliance web page ’ on the company website for which internal staff have access from their individual computers .
Identification of up-to-date information about the relevant statutory , regulatory compliance obligations , documentation and communication are the main objectives of the ‘ compliance web page ’ .
( Basically , through company website and Lotus Notes ) there are a large number of laws , rules and regulations .
to mention a few , the Companies Act No. 07 of 2007 , Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006 ( amended ) , Electronic Transactions Act No.19 of 2006 , Intellectual Property Act No.36 of 2003 and Arbitration Act No.11 of 1995 are applicable for the insurance industry and the said laws are available on the compliance web page .
effective compliance risk management is a collaborative process that pulls together and leverages all the diverse control functions within the Company such as risk management , internal control , legal and human resources etc .
at SLICL , the Compliance Department has identified the divisional responsibilities pertaining to the applicable laws , rules and regulations , and has implemented a collaborative process in meeting the compliance requirements .
as a proactive measure , the Compliance Department guides the management on anticipated regulations of the future , since a proactive business process management solution will provide the Company with the necessary tools to address new regulations cost-effectively .
further , we have identified the risk of anti-money laundering ( AML ) and the Compliance Department has educated the staff on the importance of combating money laundering when selling insurance products .
Moreover , the AML function was audited by the Internal Audit Department during the year under review in line with the AML laws , rules and regulations .
in addition , it has been emphasized that the senior management and other stakeholders should be trained on compliance requirements by various compliance regulations in the industry .
the Compliance Department conducts trainings department-wise and also educates the senior management by the way of ‘ Compliance Tips ’ through the internal communication platforms .
the Company is working on enhancing its information communication infrastructure and in future , it would facilitate the utilization of the skilled compliance capital to focus on compliance management more efficiently .

1 . according to the judgment delivered by the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka on 4th June 2009 , the legal ownership of the majority of the shares of the Company was vested in the Secretary to the Treasury to be held on behalf of the Government of Sri Lanka .
further , according to the said judgment , the Secretary to the Treasury was directed to generate profits of the Company and compute it , and to settle the attributable profits to the Distilleries Company of Sri Lanka PLC , which was the parent company of the Company during the period .
No adjustments have been made in the financial statements , with an expectation regarding the aforesaid attributable profits .
2 . as there is no confirmation of balances , we were unable to satisfy ourselves about the completeness , existence and accuracy of the amount due from the Distilleries Company of Sri Lanka PLC Group of Companies disclosed in Note 15 .

estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis .

2.9 Date of Authorization of Issue
the Financial Statements were authorized for issue by the Board of Directors on 21st March 2014 .
3 . significant Accounting Policies
for the objective of transferring to the standards of the Sri Lankan Accounting Policies , the accounting policies set below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these Financial Statements unless otherwise indicated .
3.1 Basis of Consolidation
( I ) Business Combination
business Combinations are accounted , using the acquisition method , as at acquisition date , which is the date on which the control is transferred to the Group .
control is the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity , to obtain benefits from its activities .
in assessing control , the Group takes into consideration the potential voting rights that are currently exercisable .
the Group measures the goodwill as at the acquisition date , as follows
the fair value of the consideration transferred ; plus
the recognized amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquired company ; plus
if the business combination is achieved in stages , the fair value of the pre-existing equity interest in the acquired company ; less
the net recognized amount ( generally the fair value ) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed
when the excess is negative , a bargain purchase gain was recognized immediately in profit and loss .
the consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships .
such amounts are generally recognized , in profit and loss .
transaction costs , other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities , that the Group incurs in connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred .
( II ) Acquisitions of Non- Controlling Interests
Acquisitions of non-controlling interests are accounted for as transactions with owners in their capacity as owners and therefore no goodwill is recognised .
adjustments to non-controlling interests arising from transactions that do not involve the loss of control are based on a proportionate amount of the net assets of the subsidiary .
( III ) Subsidiaries
subsidiaries are the entities controlled by the Group .
the Financial Statements of the subsidiaries are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements , from the date the control commenced until the date that the control ceased .
( V ) Transactions Eliminated on Consolidation
intra-group balances and transactions , and any unrealized income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions , are eliminated in preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements .
Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equity-accounted investors are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Group ’ s interest in the investor .
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealized gains , but it is done only to the extent of lack of evidence on impairment .
3.2 Foreign Currency
the foreign currency gain or loss on monetary items is the difference between amortized cost in the functional currency at the beginning of the period , adjusted for effective interest and the amortized cost in foreign currency translated at the exchange rate at the end of the reporting period .
non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are measured at fair value are retranslated to the functional currency using the exchange rate , at the date on which the fair value is determined .
non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency , are translated using the exchange rate at the date of transaction .
foreign currency differences arising from the reversals are recognized in profit and loss .
3.3 Insurance Contracts As permitted by SLFRS 4- ‘ Insurance Contracts ’ , the Group continues to apply the existing accounting policies for insurance contracts that were applied prior to the adoption of SLFRS .
3.3.1 Product Classification
SLFRS requires the contracts written by insurers to be classified as either ‘ insurance contracts ’ or ‘ investment contracts ’ depending on the level of insurance risk transferred .
Insurance contracts are the contracts , in which the Group ( the insurer ) has accepted significant insurance risk from another party ( the policyholder ) by agreeing to compensate the policyholder if a specified uncertain future event ( the insured event ) adversely affects the policyholder .
as a general guideline , the Group determines whether it has a significant insurance risk , if the insured event did not occur by comparing benefits paid with benefits payable .
Insurance contracts can also transfer the financial risk .
investment contracts are the contracts that transfer a significant financial risk and , that do not have a significant insurance risk .
Financial risk is the risk of a possible future change in one or more of a specified interest rates , index of price or rates , credit rating or credit index or other variable provided when the non-financial variable is not specific to the contracting party .
once a contract has been classified as an insurance contract , it remains as an insurance contract until all rights and obligations extinguish or expire , even if the insurance risk reduces significantly during this period .
However , the investment contracts can be reclassified as insurance contracts , if the insurance risk becomes significant after the inception .
all the products sold by the Group are insurance contracts and therefore classified as insurance contracts under SLFRS 4- ‘ Insurance Contracts ’ .
the Group does not have any investment contracts within its product portfolio as at the reporting date .
3.4 Intangible Assets
3.4.1 Software
3.4.1.1 Basis of Recognition
an intangible asset is recognized if it is probable that future economic benefits that are attributable to the asset will flow to the Group and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably .
3.4.2 Goodwill
goodwill that arises from the acquisition of the subsidiaries is presented with intangible assets .
the measurement of goodwill at the initial stage is given in the 3.1 ( i ) of Notes to the Financial Statements .
3.4.2.1 Subsequent Measurement
goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses .
3.4.1.4 Derecognition
an intangible asset is derecognized on disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from it .
the gain or loss arising from derecognition of such intangible assets is included in profit or loss when the item is derecognized .
3.4.2.1 Subsequent Measurement
goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses .
3.4.2.2 Impairment of Goodwill
goodwill is tested for impairment annually ( as at 31st December ) and when circumstances indicate that the carrying value is impaired .
impairment for goodwill is determined by assessing the recoverable amount of each cash-generating unit to which the goodwill relates .
an impairment loss is recognized in profit and loss , when the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than their carrying amount .
impairment losses related to goodwill cannot be reversed in the future .
3.4.2.3 Other Intangible Assets
other intangible assets that have finite useful lives are measured at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses .
3.5 Property , Plant and Equipment
3.5.1 Basis of Recognition and Measurement
Expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset are included in the costs .
the cost of self-constructed assets includes the following
the cost of material and direct labour ; Any other costs directly attributable to bringing the assets to a working condition for their intended use ;
when the Group has an obligation to remove the asset or restore site , an estimate of the costs dismantling and removing the items and restoring the site on which they are located . any gain or loss on disposal ( calculated as the difference between the present value of the item and net proceeds from disposal ) is recognized as other operating income in the Financial Statements .
when revalued assets are sold , any related amount included in the revaluation surplus reserves are transferred to retained earnings .
the cost of day-to-day servicing of Property , Plant and Equipment is incurred as an expense to the Income Statement .
3.5.2 Subsequent Cost of Disposal
profits ( calculated as the difference between the present value of the item and net proceeds from disposal ) are recognized as other operating income in the Financial Statements .
when revalued assets are sold , any related amount included in the revaluation surplus reserves are transferred to retained earnings .
the cost of day-to-day servicing of Property , Plant and Equipment is incurred as an expense to the Income Statement .
3.5.3 Revaluation
land and buildings are measured at fair value less accumulated depreciation on buildings and , impairment losses are recognized after the date of the revaluation .
valuations are performed to ensure that the fair value of a revalued asset does not differ materially from its carrying amount .
any revaluation surplus is recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity in the revaluation reserve , except to the extent that it reverse a revaluation decrease of the same asset previously recognized in profit and loss , where the increase is recognized in the profit and loss .
Additionally , accumulated depreciation as at the revaluation date is eliminated against the gross carrying amount of the asset and the net amount is restated to the revalued amount of the asset
upon disposal , any revaluation reserve relating to the particular asset being sold is transferred to retained earnings .
3.5.4 Depreciation
items of Property , Plant and Equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis in profit and loss over the estimated effectiveness of each component .
items of Property , Plant and Equipment are depreciated from the date that they are installed and are ready for use or , in respect of internally constructed assets , from the date that the asset is completed and ready for use .
the estimated useful lives for the current and comparative years are as follows :
buildings 20 years
Furniture and Fittings 10 years
Electrical Generators 10 years
Office and Other Equipment 10 years
Air Condition Plant 10 years
Passenger Lifts 6 2 / 3 years
Electrical Fixtures and Fittings 6 2 / 3 years
computers and Computer Equipment 6 2 / 3 years
Motor Vehicles 4 years
3.5.5 Derecognition
the carrying amount of an item of Property , Plant and Equipment is derecognized on disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from it .
the gain or loss arising from the derecognition of an item of Property , Plant and Equipment is included in profit and loss when the item is derecognized .
3.5.6 Capital Work-in-Progress
Unended Capital Work Capital is taken as working capital
these are expenses of a capital nature directly incurred on Property , Plant and Equipment , awaiting capitalization .
3.5.7 Leased Assets - Lessee
the determination of whether a certain arrangement is a lease , or contains a lease , is based on the substance of the arrangement at the inception date .
leased Assets
leases which substantially transfer all the risks and benefits to the Group , are classified as finance leases .
on initial recognition , the leased asset is measured at an amount lower than its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments .
subsequent to the initial recognition , the asset is accounted in accordance with the accounting policy applicable to the assets .
operating Lease
leases that do not substantially transfer all the risks and rewards incidental to the ownership of the leased items to the Company , are operating leases .
operating lease payments , on a straight-line basis , are recognized as an expense in profit and loss , over the lease term .
3.6 Impairment of Non - Financial Assets
the carrying amounts of the Group ’ s non-financial assets , other than the deferred tax assets , are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment .
if any such indication exists , then the asset ’ s recoverable amount is estimated .
recoverable amount of intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives or that are not yet available for use is estimated each year at the same time .
an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or cash-generating unit ( CGU ) exceeds its estimated recoverable amount .
the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the greater value from its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell .
in assessing value in use , the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and risks specific to the asset or cash-generating unit .
for the purpose of impairment testing , assets that cannot be tested individually are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use and which is largely independent from the cash inflows of the other assets .
impairment losses are recognized in profit and loss .
due to the lack of an active market for these instruments , the Group has decided to categorize corporate debt , development bonds and time deposits , which are not represented , under this .
3.7 Financial Instruments
3.7.1 Non-Derivative Financial Assets
3.7.1.1 Initial Recognition and Measurements
the Group initially recognizes loans and receivables on the date at which they are originated .
all the other financial assets and liabilities ( including assets and liabilities designated at Fair-Value-Through-Profit-or-Loss ) are initially recognized on the trade date at which the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument .
the fair value addition of a financial asset or liability is initially valued at transaction costs that can be directly attributable to the acquisition or issuance of an item that is not at fair value through profit or loss .
at the inception , a financial asset is classified into one of the following categories .
Fair-Value-Through-Profit-or-Loss ( FVTPL ) ; Loans and Receivables ( L &amp; R ) Held-to-Maturity investments ( HTM ) ; Available-For-Sale ( AFS ) financial assets , The Group determines the classification of its assets at the initial recognition .
the classification depends on the purpose for which the investments were acquired or originated and is based on the ability of the Group .
as the Group ’ s investment strategy is to manage financial investments on fair value basis , the financial assets are classified as at Fair-Value-Through-Profit-or-Loss .
the Available-For-Sale and Held-To-Maturity categories are used when the relevant liability ( including shareholders ’ funds ) is passively managed or carried at amortized cost .
purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame established by regulations or conventions in the market place are recognized on the date of settlement .
i.e. the date that the Group settles the money for the sale / purchases the financial asset .
However , when it comes to the investment in quoted equities and corporate debt , the transaction date ( i.e. trade date ) is used to recognize / derecognize the asset .
the Group ’ s existing types of financial assets and their classifications are shown in the table below

3.7.1.2 Subsequent Measurement
( a ) Available-for-Sale Financial Assets ( AFS )
Available-for-Sale financial investments include equity and debt securities ( Government securities and corporate debt ) .
an investment classified as an “ Available-for-Sale ” is an investment that is neither classified as “ retained for maturity ” nor designated at Fair-Value-Through- Profit-or-Loss .
debt securities in this category are those that are intended to be retained for an indefinite period until maturity and which may be sold in order to respond to liquidity requirements or to respond to changes in the market conditions .
after the initial evaluation , the unrealized gains or losses recognized in other comprehensive income ( OCI ) of the earned Available-for-Sale interest together with Available-for-Sale assets are measured at fair value , and maintaining investments Available- for Sale using the Effective Interest Rate ( ERI ) method is reported as “ Interest Income ” .
Dividends earned from maintaining the Available-for-Sale Investments , when the right of the payment was established , is recognized in the statement of income as the &quot; Investment Income &quot; .
when the asset is not recognized , the cumulative gain or loss is recognized in the investment income .
if the asset is determined to be impaired , the cumulative loss is recognized in the Statement of Income in the &quot; investment income &quot; and the Available-for-Sale reserves will be excluded .
the Group evaluates its Available-for-Sale financial assets to determine that the ability and intention to sell them in near term would still be appropriate .
when the Group is unable to trade these financial assets due to the inactive market and the management &apos;s intention to sell them in the foreseeable future considerably changes , the Group would re-classify these financial assets in rare circumstances .
reclassification of Loans and Receivables are permitted when the financial assets , meet the definition of loans and receivables and the management has the intention and ability to hold these assets for the foreseeable future or until maturity .
reclassification of Held-To-Maturity is permitted only when the entity has the ability and intention to hold the financial asset until maturity .
any previously recognized gain or loss on equity shares of a financial asset that is reclassified out of the Available-For-Sale category is amortized to profit or loss over the remaining life of the investment , using the EIR .
any difference between the new amortized cost and the expected cash flows is also amortized over the remaining life of the asset , using the EIR .
later , if the asset is determined to be impaired , then the amount recorded in the equity shares is reclassified to the Income Statement .
( B ) Financial Assets at Fair-Value-Through-Profit-or-Loss
Financial assets at Fair-Value-Through-Profit or-Loss include financial assets held for trading and those designated upon initial recognition at Fair-Value-Through-Profit or-Loss .
investments that were bought with the intention of selling in the near future are classified as held for trading .
for the investments designated as at Fair-Value-Through-Profit or-Loss , the following criteria must be met .
the designation eliminates or significantly reduces the inconsistent treatment that would otherwise arise from measuring the assets or liabilities or recognizing gains or losses on a different basis . the assets and liabilities are a part of a Group ’ s financial assets , financial liabilities or both , which are managed and their performance evaluated on a fair value basis , in accordance with the Group ’ s investment strategy .
these investments are initially recorded at fair value .
subsequent to the initial recognition , they are remeasured at fair value .
changes in fair value are recorded in ‘ Fair value gains and losses ’ in the Statement of Income .
interest is accrued using the effective interest rate ( EIR ) and presented in &quot; Investment Income &quot; or &quot; Financial Cost . &quot;
dividend income is recorded in &quot; Investment Income &quot; when the right to payment has been established .
the Group evaluates its financial assets at Fair-Value-Through-Profit-or-Loss ( held for trading ) to determine whether the intention to sell its financial assets in the near term is still appropriate .
when the group is unable to trade these financial assets due to the inactive market and the management &apos;s intention to sell them in the foreseeable future considerably changes , the Group would re-classify these financial assets in rare circumstances .
Available-for-Sale or Held-To-Maturity and the reclassification of Loans and Receivables depend on the nature of the asset .
( c ) Held-To-Maturity Financial Assets ( HTM )
when the Group has both the intention and ability to hold until maturity , the non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities are classified as Financial Assets Held-To-Maturity .
after initial measurement , Held-To-Maturity financial assets are measured using the EIR , at amortized cost less impairment .
the EIR amortization income is included in ‘ Investment Income ’ in the Statement of Income .
when the investments are derecognised or impaired , gains and losses are recognised in the Income Statement and as well as through the amortization process .
( D ) Loans and Receivables - ( L &amp; R )
Loans and Receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in the active market .
even though the existing instruments were listed , the Group has decided to classify quoted corporate debt under this category since there is no active market for these instruments .
these investments are initially recognised at cost , which is the fair value of the consideration paid for the acquisition of the investment .
all transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition are also included in the cost of the investment .
after the initial measurement , Loans and Receivables are measured at amortized cost less allowance for impairment , using the EIR .
amortized cost is calculated by taking into account discount or premium on investment if there is any , and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR .
the EIR amortization income is included in ‘ Investment Income ’ in the Statement of Income .
when the investments are derecognised or impaired , gains and losses are recognised in the Income Statement and as well as through the amortization process .
the fair values of these policy loans are estimated by discounting future cash flows using interest rates currently being offered in respect of similar loans .
the fair value of fixed rate assets are estimated by discounting cash flows at the interest rates paid or charged on assets of similar policies , currently being issued
the changing values of assets with variable rates are closer to their fair value .
( e ) Cash and Cash Equivalents
cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances , call deposits and Reverse Repurchase agreements with maturities of three months or less from the acquisition date , that are subjected to an insignificant risk of changes in their fair value , and are used by the Group in the management of its short-term commitments .
3.7.1.3 Derecognition
the Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire , or when it transfers the financial asset in a transaction in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or in which the group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the financial asset .
any interest on transferred financial asset produced or retained by the group , which qualifies for recognition , is identified as a separate asset or liability in the financial position report .
on derecognition of a financial asset , the difference between the carrying amount of the asset ( or the carrying amount allocated to the portion of the asset transferred ) and consideration received ( including any new asset obtained less any new liability acquired ) is recognised in profit or loss .
the Group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged , cancelled or expired .
3.7.2 Non-Derivative Financial Liabilities
the Group initially recognises debt securities issued and subordinated liabilities on the date that they are originated .
all other financial liabilities ( including liabilities designated as fair value through profit or loss ) are recognized on Commencement Day , the date on which the Group became a party to the contractual provision of the instrument .
the Group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged , cancelled or expire .
the non-derivative financial liabilities are classified into the other financial liabilities category .
such financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value less any directly attributable transaction costs .
subsequent to initial recognition , these financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method .
other financial liabilities comprise loans and borrowings , bank overdrafts , and trade and other payables .
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group ’ s cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents on the requirement of the statement of cash flows .
Unearned Premium Reserves are assessed in accordance with Guidelines of Insurance Industry Regulation Act No. 43 of 2000 .
( i.e. based on the 365 basis )
the Incurred But Not Reported ( IBNR ) and Incurred But Not Enough Reported ( IBNER ) claims reserves are actuarially computed .
No provision for equalization or catastrophe reserves is recognized . the liabilities are derecognized when the obligation to pay a claim is expired , discharged or cancelled .
if the corresponding loan of the Title Insurance Policy is settled before the maturity , full premium of such policies remaining as at the date of settlement of such loan , is recognized in profit and loss , upon the confirmation of the respective Bank .
3.7.3 Stated Capital
ordinary Shares - Ordinary shares are classified as equity .
incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares are recognised as a deduction from equity , net of any tax effects .
3.7.4 Amortized Cost Measurement
the amortized cost of a financial asset or liability is the amount at which the financial asset or liability is measured at initial recognition , minus principal repayments , plus or minus the cumulative amortization using the effective interest method of any difference between the initial amount recognised and the maturity amount , minus any reduction for impairment .
3.7.5 Fair Value Measurement
fair value is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged , or a liability settled , between knowledgeable willing parties in an arm ’ s length transaction on the date of assessment .
the Group measures the fair value of an instrument using quoted prices available for that instrument in an active market .
( categorized as Level 1 )
a market is regarded as active , if the quoted prices are readily and regularly available , and represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm ’ s length basis .
if a market for a financial instrument is not active , then the Group establishes fair value using a valuation technique .
( categorized as Level 2 )
valuation techniques include using recent arm ’ s length transactions between knowledgeable , willing parties ( if available ) , reference to the current fair value of other instruments that are substantially the same , discounted cash flow analyses and option pricing models .
for discounted cash flow techniques , the estimated future cash flows are based on management ’ s best estimates and the discount rate used is a market-related rate for a similar instrument .
the use of different pricing models and assumptions could produce materially different estimates of fair values .
if the fair value cannot be measured reliably , these financial instruments are measured at cost , of the fair value of the consideration paid for the acquisition of the investment or the amount received on issuing the financial liability .
( categorized as Level 3 ) All transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition are also included in the cost of the investment .
the best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument at initial recognition is the transaction price , i.e. the fair value of the consideration given or received , unless the fair value of that instrument is evidenced by comparison with other observable current market transactions in the same instrument , i.e. without modification or repackaging , or based on a valuation technique whose variables include only data from observable markets .
when the transaction price provides the best evidence of fair value at initial recognition , the financial instrument is initially measured at the transaction price .
any difference between this price and the value initially obtained from a valuation model is subsequently recognised in profit or loss on an appropriate basis over the life of the instrument but not later than when the valuation is supported wholly by observable market data or the transaction is closed out .
3.7.6 Identification and Measurement of Impairment
the Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is any evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired .
a financial asset or a group of financial assets is deemed to be impaired if , and only if , there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset ( an incurred ‘ loss event ’ ) and that loss event has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or the group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated .
evidence of impairment may include indications that the debtors or a group of debtors is experiencing significant financial difficulty , default or delinquency in interest or principal payments , the probability that they will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation and where observable data indicate that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows , such as changes in arrears or economic conditions that correlate with defaults .
3.7.6.1 Financial Assets Carried at Amortized Cost
for financial assets carried at amortized cost , the Group first assesses individually whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for financial assets that are individually significant , or collectively for financial assets that are not individually significant .
if the Group determines that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset , whether significant or not , the asset is included in a group of financial assets with similar credit risk characteristics and collectively assesses them for impairment .
assets that are individually assessed for impairment and for which there is an impairment loss , or continues to be recognized , are not included in a collective assessment of impairment .
if there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on assets carried at amortized cost has been incurred , the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and the present value of estimated future cash flows ( excluding future expected credit losses that have not been incurred ) discounted at the financial asset ’ s original effective interest rate .
if a loan has a variable interest rate , the discount rate for measuring any impairment loss is the current effective interest rate .
the carrying amount of the asset is reduced by using an allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognised in the Statement of Income .
interest income continues to be accrued on the reduced carrying amount and is accrued using the rate of interest used to discount the future cash flows for the purpose of measuring the impairment loss .
the interest income is recorded as a part of investment income in the Statement of Income .
when there is no realistic prospect of future recovery , loans together with the associated allowances are written-off , and all collaterals have been realised or have been transferred to the Group .
if , in a subsequent year , the amount of the estimated impairment loss increases or decreases because of an event occurring after the impairment was recognised , the previously recognised impairment loss will be increased or reduced by adjusting the allowance account .
if a future write-off is later recovered , the recovery is credited to the ‘ Investment Income ’ in the Statement of Income .
the group has not experienced any indication of impairment , thus no impairment losses were recognised during the financial year .
3.7.6.2 . Available-for-Sale Financial Assets ( AFS )
for Available-For-Sale financial assets , the Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is objective evidence that an investment or a group of investments is impaired .
in the instances where , debt instruments are classified as Available-For-Sale , the impairment is assessed based on the same criteria as financial assets carried at amortized cost .
However , the amount recorded for impairment is the cumulative loss measured as the difference between the amortized cost and the current fair value , less any impairment loss on that investment previously recognised in the Statement of Income .
future interest income continues to be accrued based on the reduced carrying amount of the asset and is accrued using the rate of interest used to discount the future cash flows for the purpose of measuring the impairment loss .
the interest income is recorded as a part of the ‘ Investment Income ’ .
if , in a future year , the fair value of a debt instrument increases and the increase can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in the Statement of Income , the impairment loss is reversed through the Statement of Income .
3.7.7 Offsetting of Financial Investments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the Statement of Financial Position , only when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis , or to realise the assets and settle the liability simultaneously .
3.8 Deferred Expenses
3.8.1 Deferred Acquisition Cost ( DAC )
those direct and indirect costs incurred during the financial period arising from the writing or renewing of insurance contracts are deferred and amortized over the period in which the related revenues are earned .
all other acquisition costs are recognised as an expense when incurred .
the Deferred Acquisition Costs ( DAC ) is applicable only to Non-Life Insurance Contracts .
No DAC is calculated for Life Insurance Contracts as the acquisition costs are incurred in line with the revenues earned .
in line with the available regulations and guidelines from the Insurance Board of Sri Lanka ( IBSL ) , the DAC is calculated based on the 365 basis .
an impairment review is performed at each reporting date or more frequently when an indication of impairment arises .
when the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount , an impairment loss is recognised in the Statement of Income .
No such indication of impairment was experienced during the year
DAC is derecognised when the related contracts are either settled or disposed .
3.9 Reinsurance
the Company cedes insurance risk in the normal course of business to recognised reinsurers through formal reinsurance arrangements .
reinsurance assets include the balances due from reinsurance companies for paid and unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses .
amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the outstanding claims provision or settled claims associated with the reinsurer ’ s policies and are in accordance with the related reinsurance contract .
Gross Reinsurance is recorded in the Statement of Financial Position unless a right to offset exists .
reinsurance assets are reviewed for impairment at each reporting date , or more frequently , when an indication of impairment arises during the reporting year .
impairment occurs when there is an objective evidence that the Company may not receive all outstanding amounts due , under the terms of the contract as a result of an event that occurred after initial recognition of the reinsurance asset and the event has a reliable measurable impact on the amounts that the Group will receive from the reinsurer .
if there is an impairment loss , it is reported in the Statement of Income .
Ceded reinsurance arrangements do not relieve the Company from its obligations to policyholders .
reinsurance assets or liabilities are derecognised when the contractual rights are extinguished or expired or when the contract is transferred to another party .
3.10 Premium Receivable
Insurance receivables are recognised when due and measured on initial recognition at the fair value of the consideration receivable .
Collectability of premiums is reviewed on an ongoing basis
according to the Premium Payment Warranty ( PPW ) directive issued by the Insurance Board of Sri Lanka ( IBSL ) , all Non-Life Insurance Policies are issued in accordance with PPW and are cancelled upon the expiry of 60 days , if not settled .
the Company accounts for life insurance premiums on accrual basis with the implementation of SLFRS / LKAS .
accordingly , due life insurance premiums ( only the premiums due in the 30 day grace period ) are recognised at each reporting date and will be reversed if the premiums are not settled during the subsequent month .
thus , the policies will be lapsed as per the Company policy .
3.11 Other Assets
3.11.1 Other Receivables and Dues from Related Parties Other receivables and dues from related parties are recognised at cost less allowances for bad and doubtful debt receivables .
3.11.2 Inventories
inventories include all consumable items , which are stated at lower to the cost and net realizable value .
3.12 Liabilities and Provisions
3.12.1 Insurance Contract Liabilities
3.12.1.1 Insurance Provision -
Life Insurance Life insurance liabilities are recognised when contracts are entered into and premiums are charged .
these liabilities are measured , using the net premium method as specified by the Insurance Board of Sri Lanka ( IBSL ) based on the recommendations of the Independent Consultant Actuary .
the liability is determined as the sum of the discounted value of the expected future benefits , less the discounted value of the expected future premiums that would be required to meet the future cash outflows based on the valuation assumptions used .
the liability is computed based on IBSL specified guidelines and current assumptions , which vary , based on the contract type .
Furthermore , adjustments are performed to capture the likely liabilities that may arise due to the reviving of the currently lapsed contracts in the future .
as required by the SLFRS 4 - ‘ Insurance Contracts ’ , the Company performed a Liability Adequacy Test ( LAT ) in respect of life insurance contract liabilities with the assistance of an external actuary .
in performing the liability adequacy test , current best estimates of future contractual cash flows , including related cash flows such as claims handling and policy administration expenses , policyholder options and guarantees , as well as investment income from assets backing such liabilities , were used .
3.12.1.2 Insurance Provisions
non-life Insurance - Non-Life Insurance contract liabilities include the outstanding claims provision including IBNR and IBNER , the provision for unearned premium and the provision for premium deficiency .
the outstanding claims provision is based on the estimated ultimate cost of all claims incurred but not settled at the reporting date , reported or not , related claims handling costs and reduction for the expected value of salvage and other recoveries .
Delays can be experienced in the notification and settlement of certain types of claims .
therefore , the ultimate cost of these cannot be known certainly at the reporting date .
the valuation of unearned premium reserve are measured in accordance with guidelines of the Regulation of Insurance Industry Act No. 43 of 2000 .
( i.e. based on the 1 / 24 basis )
the Incurred But Not Reported ( IBNR ) and Incurred But Not Enough Reported ( IBNER ) claims reserve are actuarially computed .
liabilities are not discounted at the current value of the amount .
No provision for equalisation or catastrophe reserves is recognised
the liabilities are derecognised when the obligation to pay a claim is expired , discharged or cancelled .
as required by the SLFRS 4 - ‘ Insurance Contracts ’ , the Company performed a Liability Adequacy Test ( LAT ) in respect of non-life insurance contract liabilities with the assistance of the external actuary .
3.12.1.3 Title Insurance Reserves
Title insurance reserve is maintained by the Company to pay potential claims arising from the title insurance policies .
Title insurance policies are normally issued for a long period such as 5 years or more .
thus , no profit is recognised in the first year of the policy , as there is a higher probability of claims occurring in that year .
from the 2nd year onwards , the profit is recognised by amortizing the premium received and will be distributed throughout the remaining period of the policy , using the straight-line method .
profit for the first year will only be recognised in the 2nd year and thereafter it is periodically recognised .
3.13 Employee Benefits
3.13.1 Short-Term Benefits
short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are considered expensed , as the related service is provided .
a liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or profit-sharing plans , if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee , and if that obligation can be estimated reliably .
if the corresponding loan of the Title Insurance Policy issued is settled before the maturity , full premium of such policies remaining as at the date of settlement of such loan is recognised in profit and loss , upon the confirmation of the respective Bank .
3.13.2 Defined Contribution Plans
a defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which an entity pays fixed contributions into a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts .
obligations for contributions to defined contribution plans are recognised as an expense in profit and loss when incurred .

the group and employees contribute 15 % and 10 % respectively of the salary to EPF .
Employees ’ Trust Fund
all employees of the Group are members of the Employees ’ Trust Fund ( ETF ) .
the Group contributes 3 % of the salary of each employee to ETF .
3.13.3 Defined Benefit Plans
a defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan other than a defined contribution plan .
the liability recognised in the Financial Statements in respect of defined benefit plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation as at the reporting date .
the defined benefit obligation is calculated by a qualified actuary as at the reporting date using the Projected Unit Credit ( PUC ) method as recommended by LKAS 19 - ‘ Employee Benefits ’ .
the actuarial valuation includes making assumptions about discount rate , salary increment rate and balance service period of employees .
due to the long-term nature of the plans , such estimates are subjected to a significant uncertainty .
under the Payment of Gratuity Act No. 12 of 1983 , the liability to an employee arises only on completion of 5 years of continued service .
the liability is not externally funded .
Actuarial Gains and Losses All actuarial gains or losses are recognized immediately in profit or loss using effective detection methods .
3.14 Provisions
allocations are recognized , if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably , as a result of a past event , and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation .
allocations are determined by discounting , the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability , where appropriate .

benefits and expenses are provided against such revenue to recognise profits over the estimated life of the policies .
for single premium business , revenue is recognized at the date on which the policy is effective .
3.15.1.2 Non-Life Insurance Business
Gross written premiums - non-life insurance comprises the total premiums received / receivable premiums for the whole coverage period provided by the contracts entered into , during the accounting period .
generally recognised , Gross Written Premium is written upon the inception of the policy .
upon inception of the Contract , premiums are recorded as written and are earned primarily on a pro-rata basis over the term of the related policy coverage .
Unearned premiums are the proportion of premiums written in a year relative to the period of risk after the reporting date .
Unearned premiums are calculated on 365 basis in accordance with the Regulation of Insurance Industry Act No. 43 of 2000 .
However , for those contracts , for which the period of risk differs significantly from the contract period , premiums are earned over the period of risk in proportion to the amount of insurance protection provided .
the proportion attributable to subsequent periods is deferred as a provision for unearned premiums , which is included under liabilities .
3.15.2 Reinsurance Premiums
Gross reinsurance premiums on insurance contracts are recognised as an expense on the date on which the premiums are payable , or when the policy becomes effective or before that .
reinsurance premiums are decided based on rates agreed with the reinsurers .
Unearned reinsurance premiums are the proportion of premiums written in a year relative to the period of risk after the reporting date .
Unearned reinsurance premiums are deferred over the term of the underlying direct insurance policies for risks-attaching contracts .
( using 365 basis in accordance with the Regulation of Insurance Industry Act No. 43 of 2000 )
3.16 Fees and Commission Income
policy administration services and other contract fees are charged from insurance and investment contract policyholders .
these fees are recognised as revenue upon receipt or becoming due .

the effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash receipts or payments , through the expected life of the financial asset or liabilities ( or , where appropriate , a shorter period ) to the carrying amount of the financial asset or liabilities .
when calculating the effective interest rate , the Group estimates future cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument , except future credit losses .
the calculation of the effective interest rate includes all transaction costs and fees and points paid or received , which are an integral part of the effective interest rate .
transaction costs include incremental costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of a financial asset or liability .
3.18 Dividends
dividend income is recognised when the right to receive income is established .
Usually this is the ex-dividend date for equity securities .

3.20.1.2 Non-Life Insurance Business
non-life insurance claims include all claims occurring during the year , whether reported or not together with claims handling costs that are directly related to the processing and settlement of claims , a reduction for the value of salvage and other recoveries , and any adjustments to claims outstanding from previous years .
claims outstanding are assessed by reviewing individual claim files and estimating changes in the ultimate cost of settling claims .
the provision in respect of Claims Incurred But Not Reported ( IBNR ) and Claims Incurred But Not Enough Reported ( IBNER ) is actuarially valued to ensure a more realistic estimation of the future liability based on the past experience and trends .
Actuarial valuations are performed on a semi-annual basis .
whilst the Directors consider that the provisions for claims are fairly stated on the basis of information currently available , the ultimate liability can vary as a result of subsequent information and events .
this may result in adjustments to the amounts provided .
such amounts are presented in the Financial Statements for that period .
the methods used to estimate claims and the estimates prepared are reviewed regularly .
3.20.1.3 Reinsurance Claims
reinsurance claims will be recognised when the related gross insurance claim is recognized in accordance with the terms of the relevant contract .

provision for taxation , is based on the profit for the year adjusted for taxation purposes in accordance with the provisions of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006 and the amendments thereto .
current income tax assets and liabilities also include adjustments for tax expected to be payable or recoverable in respect of previous periods .
current income tax relating to items recognised directly in the equity or other comprehensive income is recognised in equity or other comprehensive income and not recognized in the Statement of Income .
Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations in which , applicable tax regulations are subjected to interpretation and rules and regulations are established , where appropriate .
3.24.2 Deferred Tax
deferred taxation is provided using the liability method .
provision is made for the temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the tax base of assets and liabilities , which is the amount attributed to those assets and liabilities for tax purposes .

cash and cash equivalents comprise short-term , highly liquid investments , that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and that contain an insignificant risk of changes in value .
the cash and cash equivalents include cash in-hand , balances with banks and short-term bank deposits .
for cash flow purposes , cash and cash equivalents are presented as net of bank overdrafts .
3.31 Changes in Accounting Policies and Disclosures
LKAS 19 - ‘ Employee Benefits ’ ( Revised 2013 )
the Group applied LKAS 19 ( Revised 2013 ) in the current period , in accordance with the transitional provisions set out in the revised standard .
some of the key changes that affected the Group are presented below :
the Group previously recognised only the actuarial gains and losses unrecognized by net cumulative , in the previous period , which exceeded 10 % of the defined benefit obligation and the fair value of the plan assets in accordance with LKAS 19 .
Consequently , the Group &apos;s Financial Position Report did not reflect a significant part of the unrecognised net actuarial gains and losses .
this method is no more valid under the revised LKAS 19 ; hence , the Group changed its accounting policy to recognize totally , the actuarial gains and losses in the period in which they occur in Other Comprehensive Income Statements .
4 . Standards Issued But Not Yet Effective
the following SLFRS , which have been issued by The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka with an effective date in the future , have not been applied in preparing these Financial Statements .
those SLFRS will have an effect on the accounting policies , which are currently being adopted by the Group and may have an impact on the future Financial Statements .
( I ) SLFRS 9 - Financial Instruments : classification and Measurement SLFRS 9 , as issued reflects the first phase of work on replacement of LKAS 39 and applies to classification and measurement of financial assets and liabilities .
this Standard is originally effective for annual periods commencing on or after 1st January 2015 .
However , the effective date has been deferred subsequently .
( II ) SLFRS 13 - Fair Value measurement SLFRS 13 , establishes a single source of guidance under SLFRS for all fair value measurements and provides guidance on all fair value measurements under SLFRS .
this Standard will be effective for the financial period beginning on or after 1st January 2014 .
However , use of fair value measurement principles held in these standards are currently recommended .
in addition to the above , following Standards will also be effective for the annual periods commencing on or after 1st January 2014 .
SLFRS 10 - Consolidated Financial Statements
SLFRS 11 - Joint Arrangements
SLFRS 12 - Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities
the above parcel of three Standards will impact the recognition , measurement and disclosure aspects currently contained in LKAS 27 - Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements , LKAS 28 - ‘ Investments in Associates ’ , LKAS 31 - ‘ Interest in Joint Ventures ’ and SIC - 12 and SIC - 13 which are on consolidation of Special Purpose Entities ( SPES ) and jointly controlled entities respectively .
establishing a single control model that applies to all entities including SPES and the removal of the option to proportionate consolidation of jointly controlled entities are the significant changes introduced under SLFRS 10 and SLFRS 11 respectively .
SLFRS 12 - establishes a single standard on disclosures related to interests in other entities .
this incorporates new disclosures as well as the ones previously captured in earlier versions of LKAS 27 , LKAS 28 and LKAS 31 .
these Standards will be adopted by the Group once they become effective .
Pending the completion of the detailed review , the financial impact is not reliably estimated as at the date of publication of these Financial Statements.Public Administration Circular Letter No : 01 / 2010

Restriction the calling of Divisional Secretaries to Colombo
Divisional Secretaries have the key role of implementing of public service delivery and development activities at regional level , which are executed by the government complying with national priorities .
it is necessary for Divisional Secretaries to be available at their administrative division , in order to supervise these activities regularly and to achieve the expected results efficiently .
02 ) However , calling of Divisional Secretaries frequently to Colombo by various Ministries causes hindrances to the duties of them as well as District Secretaries .
Furthermore , it has been reported to this ministry that Divisional Secretaries and the general public have to face various difficulties , since Divisional Secretaries have to attend these meetings with a short notice at certain occasions canceling the meetings at their offices and field inspections which have been planned earlier .
03 ) Considering this circumstances , it has been decided at the meeting of Cabinet of Ministers held on 18th July 2013 , to restrict calling of Divisional Secretaries to Colombo .
04 ) Accordingly , Divisional Secretaries should be called to Colombo only for conferences and meetings , which are held in respect of highly essential issues .
Furthermore , the requests of calling to Colombo should be submitted to me and in accordance with the requests , necessary facilities can be provided by calling them to Sri Lanka Institute of Development Administration or other suitable location , or through Video Conference facility .
05 ) You are informed to draw your personal attention to aforementioned matters and to inform the Heads of Departments / Corporations / Institutions under your ministry in this regard .

accordingly in 2001 , by the 17th amendment made to the Constitution , the details relating to the establishment of the Election Commission was for the first time included in the Constitution .
however , the Election Commission introduced by the Seventeenth Amendment was not constituted and the Commissioner of Elections was vested with the power to perform certain functions related to the Election Commission .

Although , the house to house enumeration of electors commenced on the 1st of June every year until 2013 , as the actions have been taken to certify the electoral register within the relevant year and taking into consideration the provisions of the Registration of Electors Act , the distribution of enumeration forms among chief occupants commenced from 15th May even in 2015 as done in 2013 and 2014 .
in terms of the Registration of Electors Act No. 44 of 1980 , as in the previous years , 1st of June of the relevant year was considered as the qualifying date .
in addition to all public awareness programmes conducted in the previous years through electronic and print media , necessary measures were taken by the Commissioner of Elections to make the general public aware about the enumeration of electors on the revision of electoral registers for the year 2014 by declaring 01st of June every year as the “ Voters ’ Day ” and launching various awareness programmes in the Elections Secretariat and at district level .
after completing the activities relating to multiple registrations and inspection of claims / objections and re-scrutinizing the names of all electors with the enumeration forms ( BC Forms ) , the Electoral Register was certified on 31.10.2014 in terms of Section 18 of the Registration of Electors Act , No. 44 of 1980 and the notice about that was divulged under Section 20 , by the Gazette No. 1886 / 67 on 31.10.2014 and through newspaper advertisements .

3.2.2 Although , the house-to-house enumeration of electors commenced on 1st of June every year until 2013 , after the year 2013 , it commenced in mid-May of the respective year .
accordingly , in the year 2015 the enumeration of electors commenced on 15th May 2015 .
however , in terms of the Registration of Electors Act No. 44 of 1980 , 1st of June in the relevant year was considered as the qualifying date to be an elector .

even though the main function of the Voters ’ Day of the year 2013 was held in Colombo centralizing the Colombo District , at the revision of electoral registers for the year 2014 steps were taken to carry out public awareness programmes in many districts .
District Registering Officers / Government Agents and District Deputy / Assistant Commissioners of Elections gave their maximum support to accomplish the awareness programmes held in all other districts including the Badulla district , where the main function of the Voters ’ Day was held in the year 2015 .
the Commissioner of Elections attended the main function held in Badulla District .
3.2.5 . as in previous years , more attention was paid on identifying the groups that were obstructed and registering them as electors with the objective of getting all eligible electors to be included in the electoral register .
3.2.6 . in concurrence with the Voters ’ Day , door-to-door collection of enumeration forms in selected Grama Niladhari divisions of selected Municipal Council / Urban Council areas was conducted on 02.06.2015 by the enumerators and the officers of the Elections Secretariat .
the perspective of the District Deputy / Assistant Commissioners of Elections who observed these operations is that this programme provided an opportunity to identify genuine residents and to accept BC forms and specially minimized the attempts to insert names fraudulently to get children admitted to popular schools .
the support of the Superintendents of Estates , Plantation Community Facilitators and Grama Niladharis in estate areas was obtained for this purpose and this provided an opportunity to include the names of many persons in the estates in the electoral register .
a special programme at the district level was also launched during the claim period to insert the names of electors in estate areas who were unable to insert their names at the primary enumeration .
obtained the opportunity to conduct house-to-house enumeration of electors through the enumerators , except in a very limited area in the Northern Province .
house-to-house enumeration of electors was not possible in 28 polling districts in 03 polling divisions of No. 10 Jaffna Electoral District and one ( 01 ) polling district in Mannar polling division , which belongs to No. 11 Vanni Electoral District , where people had not been resettled .

in the revision of electoral registers for the year 2015 , there were 873,224 names to be deleted and 1,280,942 new names to be inserted to the operative register ( 2014 ) in all electoral districts .
opportunities were provided to present claims and objections during the period of exhibition .
the notice about the exhibition of “ A ” and “ B ” lists under the Section 13 ( 2 ) of the Registration of Electors Act was published in Gazette No. 1936 / 42 of 15.10.2015 and in all national newspapers on 15.10.2015 .
since 1981 , this opportunity has been provided to all recognized political parties , as the participation of the representatives of political parties to observe the duties of the enumerators is a big support to prepare an accurate electoral register .
it is also a responsibility of all political parties to ensure the participation of their representatives in the enumeration process and ensure that the enumeration has been done correctly , without making complaints about depriving of the franchise of their party supporters , at an election time or when their supporters make complaints .
however , the number of political parties that even appoint their representatives for this purpose is very limited , and a very few number of those who are appointed contribute to this task .
therefore , the statistics and particulars about the number of representatives appointed by the political parties and the number that actually participated in this work that was initiated in the revision in 2014 and also implemented in the revision in 2015 were sent along with the letter that was sent to the party secretaries informing them of the commencement of the revisions in 2015 .

however , 129,882 names of multiple registrations were deleted in the year 2015 and the details of the number of deleted names of each electoral district due to multiple registrations are given in the table no . VI .
3.2.15 . enumerators were instructed to make every effort at the enumeration to record the National Identity Card Numbers of persons , who have obtained National Identity Cards , as the production of a valid identity card has been made compulsory at the time of voting according to the Elections ( Special Provisions ) Act No. 14 of 2004 .
even though the identity card number is given at the time of enumeration , actions were taken to inform the Department of Registration of Persons when instances in which the identity card number is incorrect are detected by the computer programme used in the revision process .
it was possible by this process to correct a large number of errors in identity card numbers and inserting the National Identity Card number to the electoral register , also prevented attempts by voters to enter their names under several addresses , for various reasons .
particulars of the persons , who produced their National Identity Card numbers at the enumeration of electors in 2015 are presented in the Table no . VII and the comparative statement on the number of persons , who have produced the National Identity Card numbers at the revisions of electoral registers from year 2006 – 2015 , are given in the Table no .

details of the names deleted due to various reasons are given in the Table no . IX .
prior to the certification of the electoral register , the draft register was exhibited at District Elections Offices and Grama Niladhari Offices in addition to publishing it on the website from 23.12.2015 to 28.12.2015 .
as done in the 2014 revision , in 2015 too the general public was informed through newspaper advertisements and electronic media to inform the Election Commission or the District Elections Offices before 28.12.2015 , if their names were not included in the electoral register .
3.2.19 . the Electoral Register for the year 2015 was certified on 31.12.2015 under Section 18 of the Registration of Electors Act , No. 44 of 1980 .

even in a context where , organizational activities related to the Presidential Election and the Parliamentary Election had to be carried out , actions were taken to hold 3 Audit and Management Committee Meetings during the year 2015 .
12.2 . during the year 2015 , Internal Audit Division of the Department of Elections took action to carry out 23 audit queries in the Elections Secretariat and District Elections Offices , to obtain observations from the relevant divisions and to provide necessary instructions as required .
12.3 For the year 2015 , eight audit queries were received under various subjects and action was taken to respond within the stipulated time frame .
12.4 . Rs . 2,706 million and Rs . 2,975 million was spent to conduct the Presidential Election and the Parliamentary Election respectively .
the cost incurred for these two national level elections was lower when compared to the cost of holding elections in proportion to the number of registered votes in the provincial Councils , which were held from time to time in the previous year .
the simultaneous holding of elections all over the country has resulted in the reduction of the cost .
12.5 . the cost for the preparation of the electoral register in the year 2015 was approximately Rs.90 million , and it shows a reduction of Rs . 17 million compared to the expenditure incurred in the year 2014 in this regard .
it has been possible to reduce the expenditure , due to the reuse of electoral registers printed for the Presidential Election , for the Parliamentary Election and incurring the recurrent expenditure with care .
12.6 . the recurrent expenditure in the years 2015 and 2014 were Rs . 5,803 million and Rs . 2,095 million respectively .
overall , the recurrent expenditure shows a huge increase when compared to the previous year .
holding of the Presidential Election and the Parliamentary Election in the year 2015 has directly caused the increase of recurrent expenses .
12.7 The capital expenditure in 2015 was Rs . 46.1 million and it displays a decrease of Rs . 32.9 million compared to 2014 .
since the presidential and parliamentary elections were held in that year , the construction work had to be postponed , resulting in a reduction in capital expenditure .
12.8 It was possible to grant loan advances for all the applicants who applied for distress loans and loans up to Rs . 9.1 million were paid to 104 members of the staff .
this displays an increase of Rs . 2.5 million , compared to the previous year .
the increase in the number of distress loan applicants this year has directly impacted the increase in loan advances .
12.9 . Revenue earned in the year 2015 by issuing extracts of the electoral register was Rs . 8.2 million .
it displays an increase of Rs . 3.5 million when compared with the previous year .
the reason for the increase of revenue is due to the increase of issuing of extracts of the electoral register for various public needs .
12.10 With the Increase of the preparation of electoral registers as compact discs while limiting the preparation of electoral registers as books , it was able to earn a revenue of , Rs . 7.94 million in 2015 by preparing and selling electoral registers on compact discs .
12.11 . Rs . 4.2 million was spent on local and foreign training courses of staff officers and non-staff officers to improve the efficiency of the Department .
13 . Conclusion
year 2015 can be considered as another year , in which both functions entrusted to the Commissioner of Elections by the Constitution viz. preparation and certification of the annual electoral register and conduct of elections were fulfilled .
electoral register of year 2015 was certified on 31.12.2015 and two national level elections namely , Presidential Election and the Parliamentary Election were conducted during the year 2015 .

notes
I . a separate file is not generally maintained in the IRD in respect of any employee from whose remuneration , tax is deducted under PAYE Scheme , unless such employee has any other income .
II . individuals whose income is taxed at source as a final tax ( such as interest on deposits and treasury bills and dividends etc . ) have not been included in the category of non-corporate files .
III . Non-Government Organizations ’ files amounting to 122 have also been included in the aforementioned income tax files .
total Revenue Collection
the total revenue collection for the year , amounting to Rs . 514,161 million and displays an increase of Rs . 21,622 million over that of the previous year .
these achievements were mainly possible due to the extensive actions taken by the Tax Administration of the Inland Revenue Department to facilitate and enforce compliance growth .
identifying taxpayers , assessing tax liabilities and expediting tax collection led to the aforementioned increase .
the percentage of the contribution of the Inland Revenue Department to the government revenue during the year was 43.02 % .
when the revenue under each tax category is compared with the corresponding estimates , the total collection of revenue shows an achievement of 84.23 % .
VAT collection increased by Rs . 20,228 million compared to the previous year .
the possible reason for the increase could be the reduction of quarterly turnover applicable for wholesale and retail trade from 500 million to 250 million while limiting VAT exemption amount to 25 % of the total value of supplies and removal of the exemption of VAT on several imported goods at the customs .
Collection of income tax as a percentage of total revenue declined to 37.33 % in 2014 from 40.42 % in 2013 , while in nominal terms it declined by 3.57 % to Rs . 191,960 million in 2014 from Rs . 199,070 million in the previous year .
this reduction can be attributed to the tax incentives that are already in place and newly introduced for various enterprises , to encourage investments and commerce .
when compared with the previous year , revenue from corporate &amp; non-corporate income tax and withholding tax on interest had been decreased while PAYE tax and dividend tax had been increased during 2014 .
Revenue from withholding tax declined by 11.92 % in nominal terms to Rs . 69,402 million in 2014 from Rs . 77,679 million in 2013 .
this can mainly be attributed to the further decline in interest rates in the domestic market and reduction in the issuance of government securities in 2014 .
a comparison of revenue under each type of tax with the corresponding estimates is revealed in table 02 and illustrated in chart 01 .
the cash flow during the year is shown in the table 03 and is illustrated by chart 02 .
transferred amount of NBT collection to Provincial Council – Rs . 20,770,860,807 .
transferred amount of Stamp Duty collection to Provincial Council – Rs . 7,918,141,767 .
transferred amount of SRL collection to Department of Fiscal Policy – Rs . 84,655,276 .

Collection of Revenue – Self- Assessment basis and other bases
out of the total revenue collected during the year ( excluding value added tax on imports and Nation Building Tax on imports ) , payments on the self-assessment basis contributed almost entirely to the total value
Furthermore the collection by way of official assessments was only 4 % of the aggregate .
this shows the success of the efforts taken to encourage voluntary compliance as the prime part of the IRDs mission to collect the revenue under self-assessment basis .
the necessary and appropriate actions and facilities taken in this regard have continuously contributed to this success .
the comparative values are displayed in the Table 05 .

Inland Revenue Contribution to the Government Revenue
Table 06 shows the contribution of the Inland Revenue Department to the Government Revenue and to the GDP in 2014 and its trends in last four years .
Diagram 04 illustrates these contributions .
total Government Revenue in 2014 has increased to Rs . 1,195,206 million ( Annual Report of Ministry of Finance and Planning – 2014 ) recording a 43.02 % contribution of the IRD to the total Government revenue .
Revenue collected by the Inland Revenue Department has continued to decline as a percentage of GDP , and recorded as 5.25 % in 2014 .
Introduction of tax incentives , breaks , exemptions and concessionary tax rates recently may be the reason for the decreasing trend of percentages .

return Compliance
programs were implemented throughout the year to enhance taxpayer compliance with tax returns timely based on self-assessment .
providing benefits to individual taxpayers to enhance voluntary compliance towards the tax laws , such as awarding Privilege Cards ( Gold &amp; Silver ) , granting tax concessions on importation of motor vehicles , discounts on early tax payments were effectively continued .
accordingly , during the year of assessment 2013 / 2014 , the percentage of filing non-corporate income tax returns on the due date was 42 % and within one month from the due date , it had increased to 57 % .
the compliance rate after two months from the due date was 65 % in corporate sector .
in the case of corporate sector , it was 53 % on the due date and 61 % within one month from the due date .
the compliance rate within two months from the due date was 64 % in this sector .
Table 07 shows the income tax return compliance rate on due date , and within one month from the due date of the years 2009 / 2010 to 2013 / 2014 .
Table 08 shows the rates of return compliance on other taxes .
the return compliance rate of all the taxes has been almost consistent even though it is not the expected level in a self-assessment tax system .
however , a considerable decline of the rate can be seen in VAT and ESC in the relevant year .
this can probably be due to the increase of threshold leading some taxpayers for not submitting returns with a misunderstanding that submission of tax returns is not necessary under such circumstances .
however , IRD will continuously take actions to achieve the return compliance

Collection of Income Tax
Collection of revenue from corporate income tax , personal income tax , dividend tax and withholding tax dropped by 3.57 % to Rs.191 , 960 million in 2014 in comparison to Rs.199 , 070 million in 2013 .
total income tax collection of the department &apos;s total revenue for the year was 37.33 and that was 40.42 % in the year 2013 .
Tax incentives , breaks and concessionary rates introduced in the recent past to promote various services , including infrastructure , electricity generation and exports , may be the reasons for the decrease in revenue from the income tax .
income Tax Collection – Sector-wise Clarification
the contribution of the corporate sector to the collection of total income tax was Rs . 22,028 million or 48 % of the total amount of tax collected ( Rs . 191,960 million ) .
the contribution of the non-corporate sector was Rs . 99,931 million or 52 % .

Note
I . total default taxes represent remained cumulative balances of respective taxes .
however , default taxes as classified above do not fully remain as arrears in the same form .
II . in the event of an assessment being issued for any reason ( non-submission of reports by the taxpayer , non-payment of tax on the basis of the report , submission of false reports or publications ) , defaults or arrears will be incurred .
the penalty for non-payment of taxes on a due date is usually 10 % , in the case of income tax it is 2 % for every unpaid month until it reaches 50 % and 100 % with regard to VAT .
when the tax payers have lodged appeals invoking their rights , against assessments and subsequently , they may be referred to the higher appellate court ( Appeals Commission , Court of Appeal , etc . ) in certain cases when they are resolved as requested by their appeals rights .
such tax amounts can be categorized as disputed taxes , penalties or held over taxes .
on the settlement of the appeals , any excess amount assessed together with the relevant penalty has to be discharged .
plans to reduce Default Taxes
reducing tax evasion was another major task of the Inland Revenue Department during the year and the plans for it are as follows .
a . the respective enactments , stipulate actions and steps to be taken for recovery of default taxes .
Although , such actions were continuously taken after the issuing of assessments , it is noticeable that a considerable amount of taxes remain in default .
B . the Default Tax Recovery Unit has prepared relevant reports of default taxes as provided in the Default Taxes ( Special Provisions ) Act No. 16 of 2010 and better results are expected from effective tax recovery with additional authority .
( an Act to recover arrears of tax in certain cases as well as to establish a formal and expeditious process in connection therewith or thereof . )
Maintenance of arrears of tax at 3 %
accordingly , Therefore there is no net addition of default taxes in 2014 .
thus it is below 3 % of total tax collection in the preceding year , as required under the Default Taxes ( Special Provisions ) Act No.16 of 2010 .
net default tax as at 31.12.2014 Rs.17,278,517,597 less
net default tax as at 31.12.2013 Rs.11,439,439,119
decrease of Default Tax in 2014 Rs . 5,839,078,478
total collection of taxes in the year ended on 31.12.2013 Rs.467,162,276,566
3 % of the total tax collection in 2013 Rs 14,014,868,297
Chapter 05
Audits , Additional Tax Collection , Refunds , Recovery Action , and Appeals
Audits
Depending on the business , the nature and size of the business unit , audits and investigations were carried out with the aim of covering the entire number of taxpayers as wide as possible .
it has been observed related to huge taxpayers dividends have been paid through more effective use of investigative resources .
in the year under review , the selection process focused heavily on this category resulting in a notable increase in back duty .
accordingly , audit functions were carried out to a satisfactory level resulting in the collection of additional taxes .

out of total amount refunded during the year , a sum of Rs . 224.57 Mn was transferred or setoff against the total outstanding taxes .
the Simplified Value Added Tax Scheme ( SVAT ) , a credit voucher issuance scheme , reduces the number of VAT returns from individuals who are registered for VAT on imports and special projects .
under the SVAT Scheme monitored by the Commissioner General , more persons were qualified to purchase goods and services from SVAT registered persons when the supply of goods or services to qualified persons was more than 50 % of their taxable activities .
hence , no VAT is collectible in these cases , whereas previously paid VAT was claimed as input tax .
539 Persons were registered for SVAT scheme during the year .

Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with Sri Lanka Accounting Standards and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement , whether due to fraud or error .
in preparing the financial statements , Management is responsible for assessing the Project ability to continue as a going concern .
Disclosing , as applicable , matters related to a going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless Management either intends to liquidate the Project or to cease operations , or has no realistic alternative but to do so is also a responsibility of the Management .
those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Project ’ s financial reporting process .

1.1 Opinion
this report outlines my comments and observations which I consider should be submitted to Parliament .
to carry out this audit I was assisted by a firm of Chartered Accountants in the public profession .
in my opinion , the financial statements of financial performance and cash flow of the Company and the Group as at 31 March 2019 have been prepared in accordance with Sri Lanka Accounting Standards .
the Emphasis of Matter - Material Uncertainty Related to long-term survival
I draw attention to Note 3 to the financial statements , which indicates that the Company incurred a loss of Rs.44,022.67 million for the year ended 31 March 2019 and the accumulated loss as of that date was Rs.230,590.07 million and the Company &apos;s current liabilities as of that date exceeded its current assets by Rs.186,339.26 million and total liabilities exceeded its total assets by Rs.177,556.23 million .
further , the Group &apos;s net loss as at March 31 , 2019 , was Rs . 41,700.33 million and the accumulated loss as of that date was Rs.223,488.73 million and , as of that date the Group &apos;s current liabilities exceeded its current assets by Rs.177,725.40 million and total liabilities exceeded its total assets by Rs.168,111.70 million .
as stated in Note 3 , this situation , along with other circumstances and conditions , indicate a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt on the Group &apos;s ability to continue as a going concern .
having taken into account the mitigating factors as disclosed in Note 3 along with the Cabinet approval on 27 August 2019 , the letter dated 16 September 2019 of Secretary to the President , provides for a statutory audit confirming that the Government of Sri Lanka ( G.O.S.L ) will support the Company &apos;s operations for the year ending 31st March 2019 .
accordingly , it has been prepared using &apos; Financial statements have a Going Concern &apos; assumption .
I do not verify my opinion in respect of this matter .

my objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement , resulting from fraud or error , and to issue an auditor &apos;s report that includes my opinion .

the impact of fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting a material misstatement and collusion , forgery , intentional omissions or the override of internal control can lead to fraud .
obtained an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances .
but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company &apos;s internal control .

Management Comment
recommendation
the value of the A340 &apos;s spare parts ( Peculiar ) which was fully provided under the slow-moving inventory was Rs.783 Mn ( Rs.793 Mn in 2018 ) and full allocations had been made for these stocks .
however , it was revealed in audit that in the Aura System ( stock system ) peculiar spare parts relating to A 340 air crafts were Rs . 728 million .
the difference of Rs . 55 million had erroneously identified in the consignment system as spare part items related to A 320 and A 330 air crafts .
though these stocks in the system are identified as A 320 and A 330 , these have been identified as A340 Peculiar items .
hence the provision is accurate .
Management is in the process of reclassifying the stock in this inventory system .
further , stocks totaling Rs . 51 Mn has been disposed subsequently .
the steps should be taken to rectify the classification errors .
action should be taken to dispose these peculiar spare parts as receiving the highest economic benefit .

recommendation
( a ) Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements
though the buildings supplied by Air Lanka ( previously Air Ceylon ) is being under Company , action had not been taken to transfer the ownership of those buildings .
therefore revaluation had not been done to evaluate the present value of the buildings .
Management is in the view that these buildings should not be considered as assets of the Company due to no legal ownership .
the company is reaping economic benefits from these assets .
therefore , the Company should be rectified the status of ownership of the assets and identify the assets as fixed assets or leasehold assets .
( B ) Sri Lanka Accounting Standards 36 Impairment of Assets

as per the Sri Lanka Accounting Standard 21 on Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates , In the case of acquisition of non-financial assets in foreign currency , those assets are converted to the reporting currency at the rate of prevailing at the date of transaction .
thereafter historical rate has to be maintained .
however , the Aura system which the company uses for asset reporting automatically calculates the asset date .
it records the ownership and date of liability assignment according to the current value of the order date ( PO date ) instead of the receiving date .
therefore , it was observed a difference of Rs.87,724,205 between General Ledger and the Inventory system ( Aura ) .
such a difference in last year was Rs.76,216,306 .
this is not possible to be implemented , as Engineering Information Systems ( ERP ) is not replaced .
the amount has increased due to the high depreciation of the LKR .
the Aura system should be developed to include the present value of the goods received .
further , the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates needs to be continuously compared and quantified .

( a ) Underutilization of Aircraft No. 4R-ALS type A 330-200
the Aircraft had been taken on Lease basis for a 10 year period from June 2017 to May 2027 , as a condition of the settlement for terminating Airbus A350 leases with aircraft lessor Aercap Company .
it was agreed to pay the lease rental of the U.S. $ . 585,000 per month for the first 72 months and U.S. $ . 485,000 per month for each month of the rest of the time .
the above Aircraft had been given to Hi-Fly Transporter on a sub – lease basis from June 2017 to September 2018 .
the following observations are made in this connection .
( I ) The aircraft had not been fully utilized from October 2018 to January 2019 after returning by the subleased company .
further , only 169 hours have been utilized the aircraft from February 2019 to June 2019 .
the average utility of such aircraft is 12 hours per day .
the Company has paid U.S. $ . 5,265,000 as the rental fee to the lessor for this aircraft for the period from October 2018 to June 2019 .
it was observed that this expense was uneconomic .
( II ) The Maintenance Engineer had pointed out that the aircraft could not be technically accepted at the end of sub-lease period on 02 October 2018 .
the Company had not considered the above report .
Closer to lease expiry , SriLankan Airlines and Hi-Fly were engaged in discussions on a possible lease extension .
but the parties were not able to reach a mutually agreeable solution .
accordingly , at the end of lease Hi-Fly returned the aircraft to Sri Lanka .
as 4R-ALS was not part of the published flying program for the period mentioned therein , was used primarily during service disruptions .
during Borescope Inspection , the Company &apos;s Maintenance Engineer identified certain maintenance concerns of the aircraft &apos;s engine as being beyond serviceable limits as per the Aircraft Maintenance Manual .
SriLankan Airlines informed the Lessor as well as Hi-Fly and also brought the matter to the attention of the engine manufacturer .
however , the final Major Borescope Inspection by Mesa Maintenance &amp; Engineering contracted by Hi-Fly stated that the aircraft condition was within the repairable level .
accordingly , the Lessor opted to accept the Borescope Inspection report and accept that Hi-Fly has complied with their redelivery obligations .
however , some of the repairs identified at the time of the return of the aircraft were carried out on both engines .
accordingly , upon satisfactory demonstration of these facts by Air Lanka to Aercap , Aercap Company agreed to make available a sum of USD 1,235,122.20 towards the repairs which were incurred .
this offer was documented through a Side Letter to lease agreement dated 19th August 2019 and executed between the parties .
steps need to be taken to maximize the availability of aircraft .
a detailed and acceptable inspection must be performed before each aircraft is accepted .
( B ) Though the Company had implemented maximum inventory levels to manage the Engineering inventory effectively , deviations had been observed in 17 no of stock items .

Management Comment
recommendation
( a ) The Company had agreed to implement the 05 Collective Agreements and entered into agreements with 05 Unions on 12 September 2014 for the period from 01 June 2014 to 31 May 2017 .
however , Director Board Approval for the above agreements had been obtained after passing one year .
that is , on September 21 , 2015 .
even though the valid period of those agreements had been expired on 31 May 2017 , action had not been taken to update them even by November 2019 .
further , Treasury concurrence with the Ministry &apos;s approval for those agreements had not been obtained even up to 20 November 2019 .
( B ) It was observed that the shift allowances paid for Company employees who work at the airport of London are calculated and approved through the monthly overtime statement itself. whereas
that allowance is only certified by the financial manager on one side of the overtime statement .
therefore , the lack of dual control over authorization for shift allowances and overtime allowances will lead to unintentional frauds or errors .
evaluations For officers stationed overseas for 2017 / 18 and 2018 / 19 , performance appraisals have not yet been completed .
the valid period for the collective agreements had expired in May 2017 .
Directives have been sought from the Ministry of Finance on the repudiation of collective agreements , but no advice had been received from the Ministry as of now .
Management should take steps to enter into collective bargaining agreements with fair conditions to both parties .
especially the company &apos;s current position of huge losses must be considered .
at present , the details of the monthly work allowance are included manually in the overtime allowance sheet .
once Airport Manager approves , Finance Manager verifies with the Time Cards and states that the overtime and work allowance is &quot; checked &quot; and then forwards to Regional Chief - Europe and America ( RH-EA ) after authorization .
after January 1 , 2019 , the Finance Manager takes over the matters relating to payroll .
approval is ensured from Regional Head - Europe and USA ( RH-EA ) prior to forwarding information to the Salary Records Division .
from November 2019 , a separate claim sheet will be introduced for Shift Allowance .
a systematic methodology should be adopted to calculate the shift allowance and a dual control method should be introduced for the shift allowance and overtime allowances .
the appraisal period in UK is started from 01 June .
2017 / 18 Appraisals have been completed in Mid-September 2019 .
the 2018 / 19 evaluations should be carried out
that process is ongoing .
the past performance appraisals should be concluded immediately .
it should ensure that future performance evaluations are also concluded on time .
